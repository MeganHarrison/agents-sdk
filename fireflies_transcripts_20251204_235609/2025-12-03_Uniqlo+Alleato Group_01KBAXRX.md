[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: That was good.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Scott.  
[00:00] **Jesse Dawson**: Scott.  
[00:00] **Jesse Dawson**: Has the cold air hit New York yet?  
[00:00] **Jesse Dawson**: Oh, it did.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Everybody's bundled up.  
[00:00] **Jesse Dawson**: And I left.  
[00:00] **Jesse Dawson**: I went to Nebraska for Thanksgiving.  
[00:00] **Jesse Dawson**: It was 12 degrees when I left.  
[00:00] **Jesse Dawson**: It's 80 when I get back home.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: That worked.  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: He's got.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Hey, suk.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: We've got Yukina 10 waiting on.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: I think we're just waiting on the exotech team.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Here's telly.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Brian Wager is not on yet.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Here's brian or joe.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Joe.  
[00:00] **Jesse Dawson**: Hello.  
[00:00] **Joseph BURDZY**: Hello.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: All right, you want to get started, Kebba?  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: I think we could get started, Joe.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: I'm sorry.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Brian will join probably a little bit later.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: All right.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: All right, I'll jump into the on site updates here.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: All right, this shows our current racking and sprinkler progress.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: We've continued with installation on system A and are currently at 30% completion.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Sprinkler team is keeping up with the rack install while doing this.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: We are currently installing the vertical pipes on system B.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: We had our final electrical inspection with the township last week and received approval.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: In addition to this, Exotech's mechanical team is continuing their conveyor and fencing install on System B.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: And that's all I have for on site updates at the moment.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: If there's any questions, we can address those.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: I think we're going to cover most of the site updates that we're looking for in either RFI or shop drawings, right?  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Oh, in open items.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Okay, got it.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yep.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: All right, I'm going to jump into that.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: I'll share my screen.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: I jump into billing.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So we did receive payment for October billing last week, and also last week we sent out pay application number eight.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: And.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: We also sent our second invoice to Exotic.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Two weeks ago.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: No parents on that one.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So onto the open items.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So we did add.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: The DeWalt anchors.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: As from the.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Drawings from Aue.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So we added three connection points like they asked for in addition to what we already have.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: On site.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: I saw that response in the agenda.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: If.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: If you can just send like a secondary email to AUE with that information.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: I just wanted you to know that the images after you flatten them are kind of distorted, so you really can't zoom in and see those photos.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: So I urge you to maybe just attach the photos in the email and ask Aaron to give you a full blessing on that detail, which she should be able to approve and then we're.  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: Good to go there.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Gotcha.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Because the File was really big with all the pictures, so I think that's when I compressed it.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Yeah, it's like when you take it out of word, it's going to come very hazy.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Like I could not see any of these pictures, but I did notice the three.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: So I know that those were the main three connections that we needed on that wall.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Right, Right.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: All right, I will cut this page out, so that should make the.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: File much lighter so I can send it out.  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: Gotcha.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: And like Mike mentioned, we did get approval on our.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Electrical inspection.  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: Excellent.  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: Is this for the local inspection or.  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: Correct?  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yes, local one.  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: So this is a DOB one.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Yusuke.  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: DOB one.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Joseph BURDZY**: Yep, yep.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: And the air compressor?  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: I just spoke with.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: The Promise, but they have ordered the air compressors in the tank.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: They will give us an update when it ships.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: And we.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: We had a meeting with Exotic, so we will be starting the install after the holidays, so sometime in.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: In January.  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: Gotcha.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Just speaking on the air compressor, did you guys hear anything from the DoB regarding the issue drawings?  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: No, not yet.  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: Is there any possibility they will do.  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: They will reject.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: I mean, they won't reject it outright, but they might have some comments, some questions, some concerns where then they want to go back and ask our engineer certain.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Certain things.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: But I'm pretty sure that they should have approved it by now, especially that we're all back from the holidays.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Keba, I'm going to do this on my end, but I urge you to do it on your end.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Let's play bad cop, good cop.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: You bombard on your side to Eileen, or if you can send someone down the street just to confirm with Ralph, I believe it was his name, or the other gentleman.  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: And I'll.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: And I'll do the same tomorrow and try to call the DOB first thing in the morning.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Just to get a status, just to gather a status on the drawings.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: I just don't want them to think that they're lost because we didn't ship any hard copies.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: They asked for electronic copies and no one's responding to the emails now all of a sudden.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: So I just want to make sure that it's approved and we're good to go with this compressor installation.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Gotcha.  
[00:00] **Bryan Wagar**: Okay, Ahmed, who's going to be the good cop and who's going to be the bad cop?  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: I think Kevin's going to be the good cop because he has to go face to face or Mike and I'll be back Cop is his pressure via call and tone.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: We can play that.  
[00:00] **Bryan Wagar**: All right.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: It Makes it fun.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Bryan Wagar**: All right.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: And the last thing here is that fire alarm connection change order which we received approval on last week.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So I'm working on working with the.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Subcontractor there to schedule an install date.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So once we order material, we should be able to.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Have him come in to put the connections together and then at least do the.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: The wiring.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: And then the final connection would be done when Hector Tech is ready.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: And that's all we have.  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: Yes.  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: Sorry.  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: Sorry.  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: To Mike.  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: Have you got any quotation for the fan surround air compressor?  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: You got some information from Ted, right?  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: Regarding the local vendor?  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah, but you.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: You said you guys are going through the same guy.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: I mean, he did give me the guy's contact information, but if you guys are doing it directly with him, I don't see why we'll.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: We should get price into it because Alice is definitely going to have the.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: The contractor fee on it.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So I. I don't see.  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: Okay, so we have to get the quotation from the vendor.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: That's.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: That was the idea because Ted told me he was.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: He was also looking for pricing as well and from the same guy.  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: I mean, if you.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: If you want me to still look for numbers, we can, but.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: All right.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: All right.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: We'll.  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: We'll try to take the quotation by ourselves.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: Ted, Ted, can you.  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: Can you get quotation from the vendor by ourselves?  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: Okay.  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: Thank you.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Cabo, with regards to the bollards.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: We had two bollards priced out in the bids.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Does this mean that Uniclo would get their credit back for those two.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: In our proposal?  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Correct.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Yes.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: I. I'll have to take a look and maybe talk to.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Brandon.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Yeah, because Brandon and I had like little sidebars about this and I know that he included those two, but he did not include that layout that we did.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: So I know that it should be very small change in comparison to whatever we're buying now.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: But there should be some sort of a credit is what I'm assuming.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah, I mean if.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: If we are not putting it up.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So yeah, there should be a credit for that.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: That's all I have actually.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Anything is.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Oh, I'm so sorry.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Keba, myself from tpg, Ben, Brian Wager, and Luther from Henderson.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: We are slotted to be on site on the 8th and I think Henderson is trying to be there around 9am and we will be there around 9:30am okay.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Brian, did I misspeak about the time or was 9am Correct?  
[00:00] **Bryan Wagar**: Nope, nope.  
[00:00] **Bryan Wagar**: Nine should work.  
[00:00] **Bryan Wagar**: We're flying in Luther And I are flying in Sunday night, or actually Sunday during the day, and we'll be there at 9 o' clock in the morning.  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: Sounds good.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: We're going to try to be there also at nine, but I think with Ben coming from New York to Jersey, it'll take us a little bit more time.  
[00:00] **Bryan Wagar**: Yeah, no worries.  
[00:00] **Bryan Wagar**: That even if you guys were there at Your originally estimated 11, I think that would still work.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: All right.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Ahmed.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yes.  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: You're going to enter the warehouse from where?  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Oh, that's a great question.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Thank you for bringing that up.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Should we be coming in from that east entrance where the security guard is, or should we come in where.  
[00:00] **Elkarrimy, Ahmed**: Where the GC checks in their workers?  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: Yeah, you can go from the GC part.  
[00:00] **NAKANISHI Yusuke[FRJP:GSCM Global Logistics Support(Warehouse Development)](中西 雄亮)**: Mike, you're there, right?  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, you can make that right and go through the security entrance.

[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: When you turn into the entrance, you'll take the right and then there's a security gate and then they'll.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: You'll just go through there and then you'll see.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: You'll see our entrance and where the cars are parked on that backside there.  
[00:00] **Bryan Wagar**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: And then you could always give me a call if there's any issues.

[00:00] **Joseph BURDZY**: That was an assumption from the beginning of the project.  
[00:00] **Joseph BURDZY**: Now we know how it's actually flowing and working.  
[00:00] **Joseph BURDZY**: We were able to adjust some dates and bring them in so there is no conflict anymore showing on the schedule.
