## Full Transcript

[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Long story short, though, if you were to say that, hey, the majority of this is.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Is 3B and if you were to isolate this other stuff out of there, like, you know, the, the only thing really is the, the three A's, this 192 gallons that is expected to be out there.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Put that somewhere else.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: This is the only one that would really drive up a different class.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: We could reference.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: NFPA 30.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: And we could take it to.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Basically rack storage of combustible liquids.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Your 3B.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Which that's, you know, if you go here, 3B liquids of, you know, in metal containers or portable.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Portable tanks, which, I mean, say that's what they are.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: I mean, we can just tell them, hey, they got to be in that.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: You know, probably this is standard stuff.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Right.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: I feel like maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think I am.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: You could.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Down in portable tanks.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Your ceiling height is a maximum of 50 and your storage and it's 40.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: So that gives us the clearance for the 32 foot.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Do we have to have horizontal barriers?  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: No barriers.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: So no barriers.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: You use your whatever.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Yeah, you can pick your minimum K factor 8.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Your design criteria is going to be layout 4.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: So go back up here to 4.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: And here's what you have to do.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: So this basically is one line of Interact sprinklers in the longitudinal flu space at every 8 to 12ft above the floor position to coincide with a storage level.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Except above the top tier, the first level beginning at four foot.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Four to six foot.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: So basically your very first level has to be between 4 and 6 foot.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: And then you go 8 and 12 up the flu space in between and.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, but that doesn't, that doesn't, that doesn't help us because we're at 14ft.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: The barrier doesn't do anything.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Barrier is not for me.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Absolutely it does.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: One, we don't need the barriers.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Two, the barrier is there.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: If we started at four and we're only putting heads in the flu space now.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, but what I'm.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Oh, you.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Oh, oh, oh, you mean.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Oh, so we don't have to have any interactions.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Exactly, exactly.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: We're only going up the middle now.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: All right, so if we apply that.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: One then, so then here's the thing.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: There is a reduction because of the overhead.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Our heads can be.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: They say ten foot, but we have to reduce that to.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: And that's horizontally.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: We would reduce it to.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: I think it's only nine foot, but it's not very far.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Reduce interact spacing to maximum nine foot.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: If we, we're gonna.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: We're gonna go the density method.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: But then what's the.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: But the only caveat to this is that the one, you know, gallons or whatever that is.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: You said can't, can't be stored there, right?  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: So suppose according to the.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: That H.G.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: i deal here.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Well, it gives us the 3A.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: 192 gallons.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: 3A is the most combustible.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Right.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: But if it is.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Stored.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: If you went back to NFP 30, you could have 3A.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Well, so you can't.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: So no, you can't have 3A at all.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: I'm sorry.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: For that, for that height, to get over 30C.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: So you get.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Do we.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Do we know where they're storing that material at by chance?  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Like where that's supposed to be at in the rack.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: It's hand cleaners, waxes, polishes, and oil additives.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: There's only 192 gallons of it.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Do you mean like on what shelf?  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Well, yeah.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: What area?  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Like, where is it?  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I got a designated area for that restored actor.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: I. I couldn't tell you.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: I mean, I could.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: I could reach out to Sam and try to get clarification.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Like if you, if you.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I mean, because.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, if you look at it.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So like, if you look at those racking drawings, Chris, they've got.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: They've got shelving and.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Yeah, it's.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: It's got rollers and it's got flat pallet loads.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: I saw that.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: We're only doing it right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: For the flat pallet.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Loads.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Motor channel.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Well, so this, this particular design.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Would.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: You're just flu face, so.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I know, but I'm saying currently in our current.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: In our current design, we're only doing the ones that are in the static.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: We don't have anything in the shuttle or in the.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Correct.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: You know, why is that?  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Like, do we.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Do we know what's in the other.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: In the roller shelling or.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: It just does it.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: It's just not.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Hazardous.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Yeah, either hazardous or it's still just, you know, encompassed by storage.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: That's just standard commodities one through four.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: All right, so we need to figure out about that.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So then.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Because the thing is, their, their actual pallets, that there's.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: That the, the bins or whatever they got stuff on is like, I think, six foot tall.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So we can't have any obstructions.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Like it has to actually fit in the rack.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And so.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So you're saying that if we change to this scheme that you're talking about, we can do.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: We'll do one.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: One level of flu space at.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Or two of the flu space, one at four and one at, I guess what, 16.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: I'd probably be.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: I'd probably be six.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Because you want to get over this.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, yep.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: And then go 12.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: So 18.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Right.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: 18, which is gonna be.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Put you in this.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So then what do we do about.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Because currently that metal at.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: At, you know, 14.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: 14ft is technically obstruction.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: It's a solid shell.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Exactly.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: You could put.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: We could just put one underneath it.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Put a line.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: I mean, here's the thing.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: It's only.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: It's a head.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: It's 109ft.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: I mean, we're talking where our head count's about to get like chopped into a third.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: That's what I was thinking.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, we just add a line underneath there.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And we're solid.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right?  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Just take your.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Now you're just going to go six to this.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Call this 12 or 13.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: And then, and then, and then you can go 12 foot more from there, you know, get up to here.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Really, you know, get your top level.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Well, if you do your first one at six, then you do your second one at 14, then you do your next one at another six, which puts.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: You like just, just put us underneath this one right here.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Yeah, basically just underneath the top pallet load.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: So you leave one, you leave one shelf for the overhead.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And so, so the biggest thing is we have to figure out where these, this gallon, these gallons of stuff is being stored.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: That's the only caveat, Right, because that's the only drop.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Yeah, yeah.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: For those, we have to do scheme A, Correct?  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Yeah, we have to divert back to scheme.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: I mean, or, or, or the.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: You could use an FPA 30, but I think it's like 16 foot in your maximum storage height.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Okay, so.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So, Alec, do you understand what we're talking about as far as the gas, like that combustible, that combustible liquid.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Depending on where they're stored, it's going to.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: It's going to vary if we can do scheme or if we do the other option yet.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Well, what we want to do is like, hey, what we want to do is we need to isolate.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: We need to isolate the.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: This stuff, you know, in.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Into one section.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And then that way we can do the different scheme everywhere else.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So you, you know, you can call or Bill might not know, but you can call Muhammad and ask him that and I'll be on a plane.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: But if you want to, you know, if you can, Chris, in He can probably speak more intelligently than you.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: You breaking up there, but.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Yeah, I think.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: I think I got you.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I said.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Loot.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: You can loot Chris in because he'll be able to speak more intelligently on the subject than you.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Gotcha.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Does this sound good?  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Yeah, yeah.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: 104.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: No problem.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: All right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Any other questions for me?  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: For me?  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: No, that was it.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: All right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Thank you.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Appreciate it.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Okay, well, I'll try to give Muhammad a call.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Ask him if he knows exactly.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Unfortunately, we even asked on the phone call with their engineer and Muhammad yesterday if they know what exactly is even going in these shelves.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: And.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: And they said that they're just assuming the liquid parts.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Since it's Napa Auto parts.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: It's gonna be like, you know, windshield wiper fluid.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Could be oils and whatnot.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: But these 55 gallon drum barrels that'll be stored, I can try to get clarity from them, but it might have to come from the owner.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Last two, three illegal wheels.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Mike, Kev, are you guys following this?  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yes, sir.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Mike, you're gonna be super out there.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Is this all crystal clear?  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, we'll.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: We'll get together and go over this.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, I think me and you got a lot more conversations.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: We'll cross that bridge after we build it and burn it down three times.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Build it again.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Anyhow.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: All right, guys, hard.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: If you need anything for me, but I mean the biggest thing and in my head, right.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: So just so you guys are.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: You know, my sprinkler brain, how it barely works.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: You gotta think that they have anticipated almost 200,000 gallons of animal liquids here.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: This 192 gallons is probably like a single pallet load.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: You know what I mean?  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: So like, if anything, like, dude, just put it on the floor somewhere, you know?  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: So if we.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: If we were able to.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: I mean, can you guys still see undermine?  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: We're looking at your screen, Chris.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Yeah, I'm just imagining in the layout here.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Does it specifically say how much of these.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Well, here's the thing too.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Like, if we go look at these, right?  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: There is.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Like.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Hazardous material storage that they may actually be putting that over there.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: You know what I mean?  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Yeah, yeah.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: So this could just be.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: The 3B and Baloch stuff.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Everything else.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: You know what I mean?  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: So that's potentially already.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Potentially a Simon issue because they'd.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: They put a hazardous material cage out there already, which makes more sense anyways to me.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: So in theory, but.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: And if that's not our concern, if there is no combustible concerns in this area.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Then we're just going back to scheme A for all of it.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: No, we're using that NFPA 30 deal.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: NFPA.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Sorry, I got them mixed up.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Just want to clarify that.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Yep.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: And then what we're going to have to do is we're going to have to add an extra line.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: But because we're going to be deleting so many, it's not.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: It'll be a wall.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: It'll be more than a wash.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Oh, we can get over.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: We can get into that later.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Let's just figure out what if this is what we're doing.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Gotcha.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Yeah, let me.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: I'll call Bill Keys, the engineer.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Let's go right to him right now and I'll text you guys back with more info.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Just so Chris, you can work back on your end.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Then I gotta jump on one of my other projects.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: But.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: But yeah, yeah.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: I appreciate you guys time.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Keva.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Mike, I hope this is somewhat of a learning experience of, you know, the differences between NFPA standards and FM global standards and ASRs and whatnot.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So a little bit.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Hey Chris, before.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Before you go, I do have a question.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: I'm gonna steal the screen from you for a second.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Are you gonna talk about another project that's not mine?  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Kevin, we're done with you.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Can you, can you jump off now?  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: You know what, Kevin?  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: I liked you better when I was in Indiana.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Okay?  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Yeah, a lot of.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Yeah, a lot of nerve.  
[00:00] **Alec Wehner**: Now that one on the other side of the country.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Chris.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So these, you see these connection here.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: These are not on the drawings, but we have a lot of these leftover.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So we decided to use it here.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Would that be a problem?  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: No, no, that's fine.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: You just use a filler pieces.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: You're good?  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Oh good.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Yeah, use it, use it up.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Awesome.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Because we were thinking about buying more of the two inch pies, but it's more expensive that way.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So we decided to use this.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: And if we need to buy more couplings, we can do that.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Yes, sir.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, I'm assuming that's what those were intentionally bought for or like on the original Fabless for.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Yeah, they were.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: They were.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: They were little filler pieces.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Cool.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: And another question.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So these, it doesn't show the heads, but.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: We noticed after putting up the in red pipes, the two inch pipes, the heads, they would line up perfectly starting on this side, but as we go towards the end, it shifts a little bit.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: We don't know exactly what is causing that.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Probably there.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: So there's a takeout.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: Because you got a thing when you put your pipes together in a coupling, right.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: There's gonna always be a little gap depending on how much you press the pipe together.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Ah, yeah.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: And you know, if someone's not pushing it all the way in, you can get an eighth of an inch per coupling.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: And as you get, you know, 20 couplings down.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: That could be a couple inches, Right.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Would that be an issue or do you think that would.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: That's part of the tolerance.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: I think you're fine.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: I mean, as long as we're not exceeding the tolerances.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: I mean, we.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: We've.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: I've.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: You know, we've had it set up to where.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: With these projects where it's only like, been since this particular one where they've got a little more, you know, strict on that.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: But even it doesn't sound like they're giving you too much grief, you know.  
[00:00] **Chris Lopez**: How far are you off?  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: I don't remember.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: We'll have to measure the last one and see.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: But.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: I don't think it's anything too crazy.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Trying to see if I can find one.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: I can walk over there right now, actually.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: You got it.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: How do we find the tolerance that.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: That is allowable here is.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Would that be from exotics requirement?  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, because in that requirement, it shows how that head is supposed to land right in the.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: The center of, you know, the.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Yeah, they give you like 50 millimeters to each side or something like that.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: It's not a whole lot, but it's, you know, something.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: So we have.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: We have these.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: So I guess they wanted it to land in between these two, as you can see here.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: But sometimes, like, we.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: We are not all the way out of it, but it's like under these in some areas, not exactly in the center.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: So it would be landing under one of these towards the end.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Here, I'll show you.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Right here.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Let me see.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Hold on.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Go to your screen.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Like, hold on.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: You're still under.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: You're still under, like the flange or the up.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, yeah, still under.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Like, that's.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: That's the worst it gets right there.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: I mean, technically they want you in the middle of that stuff because of the heat collector.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Right.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: They put that little heat collector thing there.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: You're underneath the dam.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Metal still.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: So technically you still have a, you know.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Ability to collect heat.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Right, right.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: Right.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: It's the thing that I would argue with them.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: If it comes up.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: I think you're probably.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: And there's one more thing.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Oh.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: So right now we have.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: We have the shields on only on the, the flu lines.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: So I was looking at their requirements recently.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: It looks like they want.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Shoes on.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: The outside.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Heads around the.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: All the way around on this side and also on this side too.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: I, and I don't think we, we price for that.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: I don't know if something that I need to bring to them or where are they showing.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: They want shields on it.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Are they on the.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Just the outside heads?  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah, so there are some, some heads that are on the outside.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: I don't know if I could find any pictures.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: I'll show you.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Like, just like the outside heads.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Oh, yes.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: These ones.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: I don't, I don't.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: So that's like, that's where like a flu space was supposed to be or something.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Why the hell is their heads outside.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Or that, man?  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: That's.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: That's how, that's how it's supposed to be.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: That's how it shows.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: But on the exotech requirements, it just shows a guard being on those ones.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Yeah, I'm just trying to visualize where that actually is.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: So there's supposed to be another rack on the other side of that.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: So.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: No, it's what he, he just showed was.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, you're showing the flu space right now.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: I think what you're, I think what you're asking about, if you can see my screen, you're asking about these like the last heads.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: I would say no.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: I don't know any requirement like the, you know, the robot can't come outside.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Right.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: The machine.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Right.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: You know what I mean?  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: And those heads aren't in any kind of.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: No, I would say no.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Are those, are those shields for, for the robots or are they for protecting stuff?  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Those things break off.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Supposed to be the shield and the cage is supposed to be for, you know, impact and heat collect or.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Well, it's more of water deflection than heat collection.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: It's meant to prevent water from the head above getting on the head below because it creates what they call cold soldering, which will slow down the activation time of that head.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: If there were a fire.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Gotcha.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: It's like wearing a hat, right.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Even though it's water off.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: But yeah, but then they say, oh, the cage is meant to be for protection upon impact.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Well.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Yeah, they're made out of aluminum can.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Like it's not, it's not gonna do anything.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: I had.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: The damn cage is attached to the head.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Like that's.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: If the cage was attached to the pipe, then.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Okay, maybe it might have some Help.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: But no.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: It's asinine.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: All right, cool, cool, cool.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Would you be.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Would you be doing any site visits or.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: No, they.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Yes, you.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: You know, you'll buy my plane ticket or what.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Alex might be.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: Irresponsible for that Office tomorrow we're going to have some words.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Highly unlikely.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Kilo.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: So no.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: All right.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: I exclude those from my design proposal.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: I'll change, order you for it.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: You ain't gonna like it.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: I'm flying first class.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: I want to live like Raymond.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: Seriously.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: All right, cool, cool, cool.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: Well, I got another question for you in.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: In the actual purpose of this meeting, if you're ready to stop hijacking, because.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: This is the only reason we joined, because we wanted to talk to Chris about this.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: Damn it.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: Sound like they're trying to ambush you, Chris.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: I know.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: I got pretty good at this game.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: I'll fight you all off together.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: What's up?  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: Well, now.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: Now I'm a little concerned if there's a possibility or idea that we're going to be significantly dropping the amount of pipes in the heads.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: I sent a purchase order to Accufire.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: Do I need to tell them to pause that?  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: Yes, me.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: All right.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: If they have not started any fabrication yet.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Yeah, tell them.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Not doing fab.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Yeah, I mean, I'm assuming your P.O.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: you can go back and, you know, change the amount because you're gonna have to get a reprice.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: The design's different, the layout's gonna be different.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah, I'll just tell off something.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Some concerns are rising, so they can hold off for now.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: There might be changes or something like that.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: I'm going to say please call any fabrication of pipes for this for now.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Yes.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Should have told you to use a different supplier.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: Well, it's funny.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: I talked to Michael Murphy on the phone this morning because I reached out to him for pricing for Siva Burnville Phase two, and he said no.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: You guys went with my competitor during Siva, and sounds like you guys had a lot of problems.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: I was like, okay, well, maybe you can be a help.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: But I know that both of them suck, so I don't really know what to believe.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, I think those problems rose from the wreck, not necessarily the pipe itself.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: Yeah, I'm getting pricing from him, and I'm gonna get pricing from the other guy, too.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: So who is the other guy?  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: What was it, core or something?  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Corn.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Me?  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: Yeah, man.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: I trust.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: Yeah, Mike, you know better than I do.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: So I'll get competitive pricing from both of them.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: But whoever you prefer to use, you know, I'm going to listen to you.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: So.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: But I'm gonna list.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: I'm gonna.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: I'm gonna reach out to Dan right now anyways, because that's what we're going with for this.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: So Dan and Michael, that is.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Gotcha.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: But.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: But, yeah.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: All right, Well, I appreciate you guys.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: I'll tell them to halt.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: And, Chris, like I said, I'll try to get in touch with the designer for the racks and see if he has any info on where, if there's any combustibles being stored in the first place and if there is, exactly where they are.  
[00:01] **Chris Lopez**: Gotcha.  
[00:01] **Alec Wehner**: All right, thanks, guys.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Thank you.
