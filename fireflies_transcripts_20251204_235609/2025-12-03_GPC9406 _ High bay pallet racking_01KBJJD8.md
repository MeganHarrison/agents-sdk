Pallet Racking, Sprinkler Clearance, FM Global, NFPA, Self-Insured, Fire Safety Standards



## Overview

- **Sprinkler Clearance Requirements:** Maintain **72 inches clearance per pallet level plus 6 inches lift-off**, totaling **172 inches** for safety compliance.  
- **Racking Structural Changes:** Uprights increased from **3 to 4 inches** to meet clearance, requiring vendor rework.  
- **Fire Safety Standards:** Facility is **self-insured; FM Global standards** are optional, but fire marshal approved current layout with conditions.  
- **Product Storage Impact:** Combustible automotive products lead to strict fire safety requirements in racking and sprinkler design.  
- **Communication Gaps Identified:** Misalignment in ASR design and racking standards caused confusion, necessitating clearer integration.  
- **Future Coordination Efforts:** Brandon will review standards and risks, working closely with team for compliance and vendor communication.

[00:00] **Mohammed Radwan**: Hey Brandon.  
[00:00] **Mohammed Radwan**: Good afternoon.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Hey Mohammed, how are you?  
[00:00] **Mohammed Radwan**: Good, and you?  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Well, doing well.  
[00:00] **Mohammed Radwan**: Just waiting for Bill.  
[00:00] **Mohammed Radwan**: Let's give it another minute.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Hey Bill.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Good afternoon.  
[00:00] **Mohammed Radwan**: Good afternoon.  
[00:00] **Mohammed Radwan**: Rather.  
[00:00] **Mohammed Radwan**: Do you want to wait for Alec or we can.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: No, we can go ahead and start.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Mohammed Radwan**: Bill, you want to take it off from here?  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Go ahead, Bill.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: No, go ahead, Brian.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: No, I was just gonna, I was gonna ask you.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So I, I read your email earlier about you said 72 inches, but that drawings is 172, so I was a bit confused.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Okay, so.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: So the.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: My understanding and I can't recall who it came from, I thought it was, I thought it was from gcp.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Maybe, maybe it was from, from your group, I don't know.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: But every two.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Every two layers or every two levels needed a need to have the sprinkler system run through.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: With the layout that we have.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: We've got the two levels, each one of them, the pallet height on each one of them is, is a 72 inches.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: And then I need lift off clearance which is roughly around 6 inches is what we figure.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: So that stack up.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: So I got 72, I got another 72 on top of it, which gives me my 12ft and then I've got a 6 inch lift off from there.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Then I also have the beam thickness in the clearances around the beam.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: And then there was a, a meeting at some point in time where we had to be a foot away from the head itself.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: And that's how the stack up came to be the 170, 172.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: That clearance about the foot thing that I think you're referencing, that was about, with the ASRs, we were talking about having that clearance.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Going in for that with those heads.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: You know, I was, you know, to my knowledge, I mean, I don't recall really ever speaking anything about the static because this is, the static one is, is very straightforward.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: You know, this scheme A is pretty basic.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: This is what's the products again that they're storing in here?  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: It, it varies.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: It could be, it could be anything from.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Containers of.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: I don't know.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: What I'm trying to think of, windshield wiper fluid and that kind of stuff.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Gotcha.  
[00:00] **Mohammed Radwan**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: It's anything automotive related.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: But it's combustible.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Is it combustible liquids?  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right?  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: I don't think, I don't know if it's all combustible liquids that's being.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Housed here or not because a lot of that stuff goes into the, a lot of it goes into the Hazmat room.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Right.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: So there's some of it going in hazmat.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: But there is battery storage here.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Like on the pushback.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: There's battery storage.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: I know that.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: So.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Which is, you know.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Combustible.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So if I'm point up our drawings here.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Share the screen real quick.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So this is.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: This is where our in rec is, right over here.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Correct.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: This is what we're talking about.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: That's what.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: That's the racking we're talking about.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Yes.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: All right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And this.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So this is our type A, right, that we were talking about.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: This is our type A sprinkler system.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Which is what you show here.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: This is just rotated.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Correct.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: And then there's type C there also.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Yeah, that's just this one, which is.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Right.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Which is what we call the pushback rack.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: So.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yep, yep.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: That's the same height.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So this is.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: This is where you get your.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Your again, your 172.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: But.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So you're saying that.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I guess.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: What's this?  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: This 82.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: But your first line is at 72.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Your first one.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Like, this is your four.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Correct.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Correct.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And this height right here for this four is what exactly?  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: It's.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Well, you can see it.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: It's 78 inches clear.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Gotcha.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And so 78.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And then another 78.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Because the biggest thing is just where our heads are, right?  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: That's where kind of we have to be.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So this is our.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: This is what we.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: This is what he sent you.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: This is our scheme A.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: That we're looking at here.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And so this is this.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I mean, this can't change at all.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: This is like they have.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: You have to have.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: That exact clearance.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: I wouldn't say it couldn't change at all, but I still need to have clearance for some kind of liftoff.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Right.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: And then going back with what.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: And these were conversations we had with alleatogroup a while back.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: And these were back in probably July when we were kind of going through all this stuff.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: I started asking questions of alleatogroup on.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: On what.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: What they wanted in the racking.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: And they came back and said we wanted to keep all that at 70, basically a maximum of 72 inches.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: So I've got to maintain that pretty much a clearance of.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Of 78 inches.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: This.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: From.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: From level to level.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Right.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: So that's, you know, your 72 plus your 6 inches of.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Of lift off for the pallet itself.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Is what I got to maintain.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: And that.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: I think that's where we came up basically at the 72 inches or 172 inches.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Because if I get the 78 inches and I think that beams four.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Well, I got the 78 inches.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: If I double that, right.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: I'm at 156, 13ft and then, and then if I got, you know, I gotta have beam clearance.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: So I think that's a 4 inch beam.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: In there.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: So you're at 160 there.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Plus if I got to be a foot away from.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: You said four inch beam.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: What do you, you talk about this?  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: So the beam itself.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Yeah, well.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: The beam itself, if you look over in the, and you can see it in the, in the other view, that beam's four inches thick.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Which view do I.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: One is smart profile A there on the left.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: No, the, the one vertical.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Yeah, that one there where your cursor is.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: See right there's my clearance, my 78 inches.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Clear.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Right.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: And then I got a four inch beam.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Oh, okay, that's what you're saying.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, this, this right here.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I see.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Yeah, yeah, it's gotcha.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Right, Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, it's this.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: And I thought, I thought there was a, somebody had said that, that we weren't under FM Global standards here.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Well, we're not.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: They're, they're self insured.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Which is, you know, why they.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Mohammed Radwan**: So Brandon, if they are self insured, they don't need to adhere to the FM Global.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I mean that's, you know that.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Without like.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So FM Global is.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Factory Mutual is an insurance company.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And so, you know, essentially they, they so many people like so many other insurance companies and everybody else, they say you have to meet code.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Oftentimes like with ASRs, I mean they're the, the NFPA does that.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Everybody falls does not address ASRs systems.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So you have to revert to FM Global 8 34.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And so you cannot apply an NFPA and an FM, you got to do one or the other and it's got to be uniform for the building.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So that's where you get the FM Global requirements.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: That's where that comes from.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And so technically these guys are self insured, so they, they don't have to adhere to FM Global.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: That's just, you know what you revert to within a.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Because the only thing that governs an ASRs, but technically, yes, there's nothing that requires them to do so unless it's their own insurance company saying, hey, adhere these standards.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I need to double check what NFPA is.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I'm pretty sure it's the same.  
[00:00] **Mohammed Radwan**: So what about the fire market?  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Because.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: What'S, what'd you say what was the question?  
[00:00] **Mohammed Radwan**: What about the fire marshal?  
[00:00] **Mohammed Radwan**: Did you get approval from him or are we.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, yeah, they approved the drawing.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah because they this.  
[00:00] **Mohammed Radwan**: Did they did they raised this question or this is just internally in your.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: For me this is just internally with us.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I just, I saw that when I looked at these racking drawings I said wait a minute, that that's not going to.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: So.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: This, this came about.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Like I said back, back around early Jan July and.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: It was alleatogroup wanting to stay with, with the basically the 72 inch tall palettes.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: And.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Maybe through all the conversations I think because we were having conversations about this static racking along with the.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Racking going inside the ASRs system.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, that's where you got that they're not following.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Well in.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: And I, I had went back to.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: And I had some emails that, that I went back to alleatogroup on with Sam and Tyler and all of them saying hey, you know what about going to.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Because well for one going to the 72 inch tall pallets put us further apart.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: On the sprinkler system.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: And, and that was brought up in the meeting with them.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: I know a while back.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Back, back around a couple months back in July there.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, I mean I think, I think.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: That'S one reason they were saying we weren't worried about the FM Global.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Also because of that being self insured.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: It's exactly what it is that that that came up.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: But my, my issue is by raising all that we went back and.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: And we had to go do a change order back through alleatogroup because we actually end up having to go and put in the uprights and everything else.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: It changed a lot of the structure of the, of the racking itself.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Because the racking was originally had had 3 inch uprights on it and we ended up having to go to a 4 inch upright.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Because of this.  
[00:00] **Bill Key**: Because the height we were at maintain those clearances.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Mohammed Radwan**: Brandon, any takeaways?  
[00:00] **Mohammed Radwan**: Do you want to check something or are we good?  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, I need to, I just, I need to double check NFPA like.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: To see if it's.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Maybe it's different.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: But I mean.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, I mean essentially, I mean the fire marshall, I mean they signed off.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I think they just put a little caveat that it's FM Global, that it's outside of the scope of AFP 13, outside the scope of this review.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: You know.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: But we just, I want to make sure that we double check everything and, and you know, let alleatogroup or whoever know that hey, just so you know, right like this is what FM says.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Now, obviously, you guys can do whatever you want, but this is what we designed to, and they need to understand the risks.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I don't want to do something and then be like, oh, we didn't know that.  
[00:01] **Bill Key**: Right?  
[00:01] **Mohammed Radwan**: That's correct.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: So, yeah, let me.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Let me double check this and see what the.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: If there's a, you know, if I can find a different table to apply, that gives us 15ft.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Difference.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: And then that.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: That would solve all of our problems.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: So I just don't know.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I just don't know off the top of my head.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: But obviously I, you know, knowing a little bit more background behind that, and I. I definitely see where the strings got crossed on this.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: It's.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: It's.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, it makes perfect sense now why that would have got done.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: So let me double check it, Mohammed.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: And then.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Bill, I may end up calling you if I have a couple questions just to get some other details.  
[00:01] **Bill Key**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: But I'll.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I'll dive into this and get you guys some answers.  
[00:01] **Bill Key**: Okay?  
[00:01] **Mohammed Radwan**: All right, sounds good.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: All right, thanks, guys.  
[00:01] **Bill Key**: In part.  
[00:01] **Bill Key**: Hey, Brandon.  
[00:01] **Bill Key**: Yeah, part of that, too, is we ended up putting some beams in there also to protect those heads, which actually raised, I think, raised some of that up even further.  
[00:01] **Bill Key**: Which.  
[00:01] **Bill Key**: Well, it actually just raised the overall height of it up probably more than anything.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, I think we talked.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Talked about doing that in the ASRs side of things.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Which, again, you know, I.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: We just somehow didn't get carried over.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: We didn't get crossed.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: And that's our fault for not being very clear on two different standards.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Right?  
[00:01] **Bill Key**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: So that's.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: That's our fault for not making that clear.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: So let me.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Let me dive into this, see what our options are and get back with you.  
[00:01] **Bill Key**: Okay?  
[00:01] **Bill Key**: I appreciate it.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Thank you.  
[00:01] **Mohammed Radwan**: Thank you.  
[00:01] **Bill Key**: All right, thanks, guys.  
[00:01] **Bill Key**: Bye.  
[00:01] **Bill Key**: Bye.
