## Full Transcript

[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Hello.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Good morning, all.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Hey, jhanjra.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: All right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Basically what I understand the agenda to be is you need a.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Want to update a kind of synopsis of what you need to do to this building.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Is that correct?  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: So.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Brandon, did you all get the CAD layout for this new building?  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yes.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: A.J.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: You said that just came through, correct?  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, we just, Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I just got it this, saw it this morning, so.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay, perfect.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: And by the way, I do have a rough layout of like what I did from a, from a build perspective.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: So.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Before this layout even came in, this one, this one, we just got it yesterday.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: But I, I went ahead and modeled the building based on what it would look like.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: So I can add that cat also within the folder.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yes, that'd be great.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: All right, so quick synopsis, right?  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So to take this thing to type.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: 1A building, right, so we are going.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: To have to do what's called fireproofing.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: On all of the steel.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So that's like a spray foam application.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And so we've got to get to one and a half hour rating at that deck per code.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Now, depending on what the, I don't know, the specs on these panels.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I would assume that they're, they're, they'll meet the three hour requirement.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Just based off of what.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I mean, usually that 4,000 psi panels, they'll meet it.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: But we'll just need to confirm that.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And so the only thing we'll have.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: To do is we'll have to put some fireproofing on the embed plates, you.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Know, metal plates that connect it.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And then the other thing is, if you want to condition this space.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Looking.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: At those walls, unless, unless they're what's called tips, which is, you know, tilt up insulated panels, which I don't think they are, then.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: No, they don't look like they are.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, exactly.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: We're gonna have to apply insulation to the walls.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: If you, you know, for your conditioning.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: If you're gonna do it, if you want to condition the entire space.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So we'd have to apply that and then you'd have to do, you can.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Do a couple, you can do foil back.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Or then we have to do like.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Or we could do in temescent.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: You've got some, some options there to do.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, I think we got to be.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Brandon, we got to be careful that.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: You know, I know what we did in Locust Grove.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Our FM Global, our insurance company doesn't like that.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So I just want to be clear.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Most likely would need to be.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: You know, insulated.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Exactly.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, we probably do foil backed in this application.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Now when you.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: And when you say this, we have to fireproof all the steel.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I mean, are we talking the roof?  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yep.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: And the columns.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yep.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And the joist?  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And the.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: In bed plates.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Jesus.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I mean, that's not only.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: So we would need to do what you said.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: We'll need to like steel proofing.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: It's called fireproofing.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yes, fireproofing.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: To get it to the.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: The one A.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: That's what we're talking about.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So we did that in our site in Vancouver, Canada.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: And, and that was only 40,000 square feet.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Forget the cost.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: But it was messy.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So we would, we would go in there, do all of this first.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, you'd have to.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And then, and then clean.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And you know, then that way we're.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Out of the ceiling.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: But.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yes, it's.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: It's.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: It's spray, it's foam.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: It's.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: It's messy.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: It's sprayed in and even the columns.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So what I would say would be.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I'm just thinking out loud because of what I experienced.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: You know, you can't.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: We can't.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Up to a certain.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I'll say.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: We'll say 12ft or so on those columns.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: They're going to have to be.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: You can't just leave them with that insulation on it.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: No, we would do.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: We would do intumescent paint there.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Okay, you would just paint them because I don't.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So it's a specific type of paint.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: It's called intumescent.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And it's, it's.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: It's basically gets you the fire barrier.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: It's the same thing as fireproofing, except it's.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: It's exactly what you're talking about.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: You put down low.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, yeah.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Because that spray in, if you put that on columns, it gets chipped off.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Correct.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: And then where.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: You see the.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: That yellow is what we would paint.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Intimacy.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: And then if we.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Not all the way up, I mean.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: We could do whatever you want.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I would not.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I don't see a reason to do all the way up because nobody should be up that high.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Like.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Right, okay.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: So it just, it's just like you would spray that.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right, the intumescent.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: No.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So up to the, on the columns, they still need to be fireproofed, right?  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Correct.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yep.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: You would go intumescent paint up to the yellow line and then the rest would be sprayed.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Correct.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: It'd be foam.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yep.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So it would still be fireproof.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: It's just not gonna be painted all the way up.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Because that's correct.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: The whole.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Every piece of steel will be fireproof.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Has to be covered.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: And then what happens when do we.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Any roof penetrations?  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: We've.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: We've fireproofed the joists and you know all that stuff.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: If we do roof penetrations.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: We don't.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: We can do them later.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: And then we just have to I guess seal back because I'm thinking about putting rooftop units on.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So we wouldn't have to do that first and then spray, would we?  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: No, no, you know, we would spray first and then whatever if you know.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Because again later.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: All you would do is go in there and cut it and then patch it in.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Right then.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I just wanted to make sure.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Sequencing.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: That's a lot of work.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yes.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: And like I said, the walls would have to be insulated, the roof columns fireproofed.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Let's, you know the good, the good part is at least it's lighting.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: We have it fully lit up.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: The other thing we'd have to look at, I believe it's 1600amp service.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So we have to keep that in mind.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: For what the layout is.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So that's not gonna be enough.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: That's not gonna be enough.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Jump back in here and what else is required.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So yeah, so that's the main thing to get you to your, your type.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: 1A.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And then.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Who'S driving here just looking through random.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Kevin, stop doing that.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So, so yeah, so we get all that.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: The, the forest.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Fine.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: We have to do anything there.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Roof would have to be one and.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: A half hour and then everything else is three.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So that's exterior walls and then the.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Structural steel which is what that fireproofing everything would be.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Again the 4000 psi tilt up panels.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Should already meet that unless they did something odd.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So we shouldn't have to do anything to the walls other than where the embed points are.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Then we'll do you have to have a full notification system.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So horns and strobes throughout.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: You'll have your spill containment system.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So what we'll do is wherever you're going to have your flammable.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Liquid flammable area.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Then what my thought is the.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Probably the.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I would think the most economical and efficient way to do it is we just do a square trench drain all the way around it.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And that way if there's a spill it can all go down there and you know you have to have 20 minutes of sprinkler.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Run and then all that's going to go to you know you guys have that, that tank or storage that you're going to put.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So it'll all be go down and pumped up to wherever that's going to that containment area is going to be.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: But that would be my, my thoughts right, that that leaves it open.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: The biggest thing is you don't have.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: To have any firewalls.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: You just keep 20ft of separation.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Between the different commodities.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So between your aerosols, your oxidizers and flammables.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: See here.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: You have to have.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Smoke detection in the oxidizer area.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Ventilation.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So we'll have to have, you know, ventilation, which it's already got some cross ventilation.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: We just, I just don't know exactly what that is.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: But basically you should have to have around.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: 66,000.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Cubic feet.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Of ventilation on backup power.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So we'll, we'll look at that and.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Run some rough numbers of what that would mean exactly.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: As far as fan sizes and whatnot.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Again, rough calculations.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Like, I want you guys to make sure you understand.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I don't have time to do a full calc, but I can get, you know, within spitting distance.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So Brandon, for, for the ventilator does this.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So we're saying.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: And I didn't get a chance to look at.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: But there already.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Are there already louvers in the walls.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Some, some places it, the, the, the write up said it's got cross ventilation in there.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So I, I don't know.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I couldn't see any.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I didn't see any louvers.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: But in all the pictures I didn't get, there's only four pictures, right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Like, and only two of them are the warehouse.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So I couldn't see it.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, I don't really.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I see, you know, some sky, you know, some skylights or whatever, whatever we call them.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Turn some lights or whatever.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: But yeah, I don't really see any louvers.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So are you saying that we, based on your calculation we'd have to put in exhaust fans and louvers in the walls?  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Well, maybe I, it says there's, it's already there.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Like, I just don't see it.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Like, but that is, you know, okay, like.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yes, you have to have some sort of ventilation.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Like you.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: That's going to be required.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, besides, besides the condition space.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Correct.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yes.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So, yeah, so smoke detection, extending the.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Oxidizer area and then you know, liquid type 4, which just means we'll fill the, fill all of the joints.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: In the, in that area and then we'll have again, I think the trench drain all the way around is the way to go.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: To give you that area.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: You have existing ESFR above, you're fine there.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: You've got very limited racking.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So I don't think that you're going to have any issues with flow.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And even with that, I was reading.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: The actual data sheets.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Like it's almost.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Like class one and class two.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I didn't even see any class three.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah, yeah, it's basically two, not even three.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: But you know, like I said, they're.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: They.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: I mean, to be honest, we don't even need type 1A.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: We don't even need H3.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: But they're asking us to build for these.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: They understand, they know that this is an overkill, but they just want us to plan for it or design for it.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I get it.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So, yeah, I mean that's the, that's the biggest thing you said is basically.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: The fireproofing of the entire building.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And then you'll do where your office is.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: You will have a rated wall around it.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: So, Brandon, I have a few questions.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Thanks.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Thanks for that.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: I think that's very helpful and I think if we can actually get that.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I've got a full ride up Boston.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: That's awesome.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: That's awesome.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: I just need to concise it and like show them.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: This is what we're planning from a high level, like two pages.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: This is what we're thinking like here, here, like just like you said it right, we'll do these to the.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Here.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: This is kind of what I would.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Have got here kind of put together.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: It's not done, but this is what I'm.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Right, right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Working on this this morning.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So I kind of put all this.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Together to show you my thought process.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right, okay.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Kind of what it is.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So this is what we talked about, like what we have to do.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So this is your foam everything.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Again, I think we're going to be.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Fine here, like, but I want to verify that nothing has to do there.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And then we shouldn't be doing any of these.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And the reconstruction, again, we just have to do it.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So that's your biggest actions.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: It's just basically spray foaming everything.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And then here's the applications.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Would it be the same like a 3 hour rating?  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Even if it is a wall that's dividing a category of product with the next category of product.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Would it have to be a three hour wall?  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: I'm asking.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: If the whole building is still H3.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yes.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: If the whole building is still H3.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: No.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So the whole building, the separation and forgive me, I don't know exactly off.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: The top of my head.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: But you just need a wall.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: You could have like.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So if you didn't want to do your 20ft, you could have a wall.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And I think the wall just has to go like 18 inches above the top of storage.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So if you wanted to not have 20 foot between your combustible liquids and your whatever oxidizers, that I believe you.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: The wall just has to go 18.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Inches above wherever the top of storage is.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay, okay, makes sense.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So, yeah, anyway, so this is basically what I'm trying to.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: And Brandon, that would just be.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Have to be a normal, you know, standard, you know, standard demising wall, so to speak.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, Just a partition wall.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Just a barrier is what.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: What it says.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Again, going off of memory from reading.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Stuff just in general in my.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Just from my knowledge base.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: But yes, I believe that's all it is.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: So I actually did include.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: I. Brandon, I uploaded the concept of the layout into the folder that I shared with you.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: It's.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: It's inside the folder called layout.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Over there.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: You will see.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: I'll download it.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah, it's still work in progress.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: But.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: But I'm still.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: It's.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: It's a concept.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: I need to finalize it today, tomorrow, because tomorrow is when I, I'm supposed to submit this.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: So let's do, let's talk through that and let's talk through like, what.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: What else you think we need because right now, the way it's laid out, I've got the.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: One of the key questions I had, Brandon, for you is the ceiling height.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Right.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: So let's say, for example, if our.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Within the mezzanine, specifically if our height of the racking shelf is like a floor, ceiling is six feet and let's say top of the product is six and a half feet.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: What should be the ceiling height?  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: I know, I understand there has to be a horizontal barrier separating the first and second floor, but what should be the ceiling height between this, the top of the product?  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Let's say six and a half feet to the ceiling and then also to the second floor.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Because the second floor, that's going to be a. I mean, if the ceiling heights needs to be dropped.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: I don't know if it needs to be dropped or not.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Because.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: The key here is if you actually look at the layout.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: And let me just share the layout.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yes, if you want to pull that up.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah, I'll just put it up.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: If you guys are not.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: I'm downloading it right now.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: No, no worries.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: No, you want to pull it up.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: Jay, It'd be better.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah, I just, I just pull it up.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Let me, let me know if you can see my screen.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, I can see it.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay, perfect.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: All right, so this green section.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: So again this is based on this new layout, right, that we're for this new building.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: The old one was.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: This was the old one.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: This is the new one.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Now obviously I did not, I just got this yesterday, so I have not completely copy pasted it into that.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: But.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Long story short.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Exactly, exactly.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: But, but essentially you've got all of this green area that's, that's the two level mezzanine.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: All of this area right here, these are all on the floor.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Right.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: So there is definitely a.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: And again, when I, when we went and saw the floor, like even, like let's say for the even, like the oxidizers, they were about 20, 30ft apart from the pallet racking that when we saw it and the oxidizers that were on the floor, there was like the ceiling was not dropped as, but there was obviously a false ceiling, but there was not as much as, as we, as we think.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: So my question really is, is there a norm for the ceiling height to be dropped when you're storing either flammables or oxidizers or like do we know, do we know that?  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, so usually like, if you're, if you're storing oxidizers, for instance.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Right, right.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: So usually you have a max storage height of.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: For class.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: For class two, it's 20 foot in racking.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I think in class one you can go up to 25 in racking, if memory serves me correct.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: And then as far as the ceiling height goes, like you could depend.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: It all depends on your MOQ maximum level qualities.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: And so if you're breaking it up into rooms, into sections, then you should be fine as far as your coverage because you're going to get like 20.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Foot off of that ceiling.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Down there.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: So you only would really need to.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Do a false ceiling.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Like for instance, like I'm doing another hazardous building like this and it's a.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Dry system with uprights that max ceiling.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Height is 30 foot.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Are they all racked, that specific one?  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yes, it's got a racking, it's got a bunch of Class 1 Class 2 oxidizers.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: And what's so that that makes sense because your.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: And again, I'm just asking because I don't know.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Because when I, so when I saw it on the floor, I maybe, maybe the floor, like all the accident like all this blue on the, on the right side right now we're showing.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: All of this is like.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: All of this is library shelving, by the way.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: All of this is library shelving, right?  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: That's what I got.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Six and a half.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Right.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: So basically, what's the ceiling height of this building?  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Is it floor to ceiling is what, 30, 36, 40?  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Says 40 foot clear height.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: So, I mean.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah, so should.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: So my.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: My question really is, if this is all stored on the floor, is it okay to have that level of floor ceiling, or is it not that.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: That's the only question I had.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I mean, the thing is, this has a.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: This ESFR system.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Is.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: What is it?  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I think it's K. Gosh.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I want to say K28, if I think that's what it said on that.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Let me pull up that spec sheet again real quick.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: 40 foot cleared.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Sprinkler at.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Fire sprinkler.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yes.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: K28.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: They are pumping some juice down there.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: So.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, I mean.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: As far as what they're showing, we do type one.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I mean, you.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: You shouldn't need to do anything.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: You know, I think that again, I got to do the calcs on it, but with that kind of head, you should be fine at 40 foot.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: It depends on the spacing and everything like that.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: But I mean, as far as height, it's.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: It's.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: It's not necessarily an issue.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: It's just more.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: It's about gallons and over square footage.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: And I. I don't know that off the top of my head.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I can make guesses, but that's about it.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: But with those size heads, I would think you're good.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Those are big.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: And even within the folder when I shared it, you guys also should have the sample SDS sheets.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, I read through those.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: That's what I was saying.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I didn't see any Class 3 in there.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Perfect.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Other than that, I guess.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: These red ones that I'm showing here, these are like the walls separating them too.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: So you've got this one.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Walls.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: This also has to be a wall.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: In my opinion, like, the racking has to be a wall because we're storing.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Flammables and aerosols in here.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Or maybe I'll find a way to fit the aerosol racking within the aerosol area so that we don't have to.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: So we just have the racking over here for flammables.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: But I guess where I need your help is to mark where the egress needs to be.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Where the VRCs like the positions need to be and things like that.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Like that's the guidance.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: So your max Travel distance is 150ft.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: And then you've got to have access.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I was reviewing through.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: So I was reviewing the Florida building code, Dade county specifically, and they have certain requirements on.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Doors, I think.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Like you have to have fire access doors.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I can't remember exactly.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I think it's every hundred feet, but I'll double check that.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I hadn't gotten that far yet.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: But the travel distance is a maximum of.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: 450Ft.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Travel just 450ft between what?  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: So from 150.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: So anywhere in the building, your max travel distance to get out is 150ft.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: So like for instance, if you zoom in on like go to.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: To on the left side in that.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Racking area right in the center.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: So in the center of that racking.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: To go from there.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Not that one in the middle of the.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Of the thing there.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: To go from here.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: There's a.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: No, no, to the right.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Where the conveyance is.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Oh, the shelving.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: The conveyance.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, yeah.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Anywhere in there.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Anywhere in the building, the max Travel distance is 150ft to get out of the building.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: So for instance, what you have to.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Do to get out of the building.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: To get out of the building.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Oh, okay.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: So they could get out from the north end.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Correct.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: But you're just going to have to add man doors on the sides and around it to make sure that you have that minimum travel distance hit.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: So that's the guidance I'm looking from you all.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: If you can even mark it up and tell us where you think it all needs to be.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: We'Ll add them in the layout or maybe if you can just add them in the layout.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Whatever works for you.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, I just.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: The biggest thing is like, you know, I can tell you right now on the left side where your racking is, you cannot have that like that.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: You're gonna have to have a break down the center.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Like.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, those two cannot be connected because like these.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Correct.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: You're gonna have to have, you know, an eight foot break in the middle of that somewhere.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Exactly.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yep.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: After what?  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Sorry.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Like you have to break up the.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Jay, you have to break up the rack in two sections.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Oh, I have to break up the racking into section.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah, yeah.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Makes sense.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Makes sense.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Makes sense.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yep.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: And we'll probably have to have another aisle in.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: In each one of those shelvings.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: So down the middle, kind of like.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: What you're Con the middle.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah, like an, like a gap here.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I think I, I, obviously I'm not.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I, I don't know if these are.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: I think, I think it makes sense because.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, I think it makes.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: It's 200ft.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah, it's, it's pretty long.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay, makes sense.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: We'll, we'll make those adjustments.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: So I guess Jay, you can make.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: So we got, we gotta have a gap in the rack on the left.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Then we have to have some, you know, aisles put in for egress.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: And then, you know, the other sections.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: I don't, you know, I think, you know, we can, you know, is not as, you know, not as large, but if we can get that and then Brandon, then you could.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Based on that layout, you can say, all right, here's where we'll need to add doors.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Or here's where we'll need doors.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Maybe not add them, but here's where you need that.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I would think at, Honestly, JP at this juncture that Amazon just wants to know that, you know that you have to have that.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Right?  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: They know that.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I mean, we're going to adjust and add an aisle as needed to meet that requirement.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah, yeah.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: So, Brandon, my question is, let's say, for example, like in this instance, right.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Like if you have to go from the center to the exit, said 150ft, do we actually need to build an entry, like an entry and exit door here?  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: That's an exterior wall, right?  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yes.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: If there's not, if there's not one, you know, in the close proximity.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: And we'd also.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Is that elevated conveyance there.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Along that wall?  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yes.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: All right, so there's, there's a pathway under it.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yes, yes, there is.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: There is.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yes.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Because that would be a problem too.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: All of, yeah.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: All of this is elevated.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Even.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: All of this, like, even we thought about elevation.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: All of you, all of the, like the hashed conveyance is all elevated.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Gotcha.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: All right, cool.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Makes sense.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: I guess.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: I guess.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: The biggest thing I think that you're probably seeing ceiling heights is around aerosols.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: And that's where I think you typically are.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: That's where you typically are seeing your 30 foot limit.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: And I think that's probably what you're, you're, you're seeing at that one you looked at.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: That's it.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: That's the, the one place I would, I would, you know, just going off.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Of knowledge that I would expect to see it, but I haven't Got a.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Chance to dive that granular into this protection scheme.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: So, Brandon, I guess what I'm.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: What I think what will be helpful, what we can do is once I can finalize this layout today, I'll send it to you by the end of the day.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: And maybe we can take a screenshot of this and then just show them in a slide what the entry exit plan would be like.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Meaning like arrows over here.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Like arrows over here.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Like, they're just showing them directions exactly.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Like where it needs to go into going in.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: I'll.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: I'll kind of build out.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Something in direction of what I think needs to be based on our discussion today, and then you can add your comments in there.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I can tell you right now you're going to have three doors on the west side there.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: You know, automatically added three on the west.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Three on the way.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: And maybe like.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Well, there.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Wait.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: So there is.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: There are some exterior doors, right?  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: There are some.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Because this.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: These are.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: This is the existing drawing.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: I don't even know how to read this drawing.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: It's so confusing.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: This looks like a door.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: That's elevations there.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Zoom out.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: There's your column line.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: So zoom back to go to the right there.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: So they've got that's elevations all the way around the building to show you what's like north, south, east, west elevation.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: So zoom in on the left side there.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Top left is the office.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Oh, okay.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay, okay.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Understood.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah, but then there's so like there's one.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: There's one door here and there is.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: It looks like you got one on the left there.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I think.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Zoom in a little bit.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah, Zoom north, south, southwest.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: We'll have to add a couple on the west side.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: There's very few.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: That's like.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: That's not.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: J.P. i have a question.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: I. I thought all the.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: I mean, it looks like all the doctors are in the south, but you see over here, like how they have like.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Like something like this.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Is this like a cutout that they have for your doctors?  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: So what's that?  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Zoom out some Jay and go to the left and that tells you the elevation right there.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: See that pink to the left.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Zoom in on that.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: That tells you what that is.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: It looks like a drive in door.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: No, back out a little bit.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I don't think you're at the right.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Call mine.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: F. Okay.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: What is that?  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, I think that's a drive in.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: It looks like this yellow is a drive in.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Good call, aj.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yep.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay, but then.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: But then they have the same Thing all across.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: No, no, they have one here.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: They have one over here, but I don't see something.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, there's another.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: See that yellow?  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: There's another one.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: There's also driveway.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: So that could be.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: That's an elevation.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Then.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: That'S confused.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: I'll pull it up here.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: So my, my question really is, would a drive and door be considered negress?  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: No.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: No, no.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: It's gotta, it's gotta be able to.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Be, you know, it's gotta be made for people.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Made for people push it open.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Not have to like not have to roll it up or something.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Or even wait for a automated motor to get it open.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: That's.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: That's not.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah, yeah.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: And jpkennedy, do we know if this building has like dock levelers and all the other like all the building whistles.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: They show it on the elevation there.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, they're.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: They're showing levelers bumpers.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Looks like in some.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Maybe that's a shelter.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: So my assumption would be if where they show those doors and the leveler.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Is the leveler the small one or is.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Because that's.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: No, sorry.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: That's the skylight or whatever it is.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: So above.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: That's the elevation.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Sorry.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: So it looks like they're showing.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Bumpers on the doors.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Levelers.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Because it's the little box below the door.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah, yeah.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: And they have the little.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Some, some places they have the skylights above the doors.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Because is that this.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Well that's.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: That's a knockout for a skylight.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: The ones where they're open.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: That shows.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah, that's enough.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, that's a skylight.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: So I would assume they have levelers bumpers.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: They.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: I don't see any shelters.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: You know, the seals that go around.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: The doors, it says dock rubber bumpers at all dock door locations and track.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Guards at all roll up doors.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: That's the dock package.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: So we would have to add the dock restraints and then any seals, any.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Any shelter seals around, you know, for the, for the trucks on the outside.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: But yeah, at least, at least this one has levelers.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: I don't know.  
[00:02] **AJ Taylor**: I don't think it has levels.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: I don't think it does.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Well, there's still.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Well, it doesn't look like it from the inside.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: So that's why the elevation is a little.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, I think, I don't think they.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: They do because I'm reading these guidelines that they gave us.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: It just has bumpers, doors and tracks and guard.  
[00:02] **AJ Taylor**: I think, I think that's indicating like a knockout where where maybe it's.  
[00:02] **AJ Taylor**: Can accept a leveler.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Okay.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: No, it.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Hold on a second.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: It says.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: All right, here we go.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Auto parking 321, exterior truck, docks 82.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: So.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, that's.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: That's.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, they don't have levelers.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Damn, that sucks.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: That sucks.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Well, we don't need obviously, all the doors, but we were.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: We were talking like 30 total.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: I think 10 on inbound, 20 on outbound.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: I think before that.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: When we last talked.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: So I would assume.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: We should assume the same.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: So we're going to have to basically add documentary levelers and seals to all them dock and lights and fans.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Well, and if you condition it, you.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Got to change out those doors.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Because those are.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: They're not insulated doors.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Yes.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: And then we.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: And I didn't see.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: I don't know because we haven't been in the building and there probably isn't any.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Isn't any convenience power even by the doors that we could.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: I didn't see.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: I didn't see any.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Any dock lights.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: I would assume with this building sort of no frills that.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, this doesn't exist.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: So it's not even like we have power.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: So we have to get power all the door.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: So.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: All right.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Something we haven't done before.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: It's just a lot of work.  
[00:02] **AJ Taylor**: So what is the address for this building?  
[00:02] **AJ Taylor**: I'm going to try and look it up on Google Earth.  
[00:02] **AJ Taylor**: Anyone know off the top of their head?  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: It's in the pamphlet.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: It's.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: 4700 Northwest 135th Street, Miami, Florida.  
[00:02] **AJ Taylor**: Northwest 135th.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yep.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: The age of the building shows something totally different.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: When you Google this, it'll.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: It'll show you something else.  
[00:02] **AJ Taylor**: Really?  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Because I think that was the original mix up.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Right, Jay?  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yep.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: When we had the wrong building last time because of Googling it, it should show you the same one we were looking at before.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: My understanding.  
[00:02] **AJ Taylor**: Yeah, Miami Gardens.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: So.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: It'S not.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:02] **AJ Taylor**: We have the actual address of this new building we're looking at.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: It's the same address.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: I think it just pulls up differently.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: I don't know.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, that's my understanding.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: It's just not.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: It just doesn't pull up right in Google.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: I don't know if you try Apple, but they don't have Google or, you know, there's no Apple orders.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: Right.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: I don't think.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: But that may give you.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Apple may give you a different location at least because it's Miami, not Miami Gardens.  
[00:02] **AJ Taylor**: I'm on a Hunt for it.  
[00:02] **AJ Taylor**: I'll try and see if I can't find it.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: All right, so Jay, you're going to modify this a little bit based upon what we said.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: We need to focus on the egress and make sure we have something we can show, you know, Amazon, Right.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: That we have covered.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Obviously, you know, we're going to have to.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Based on the existing man exits that are there, which are very few, we're going to have to add in several on each, you know, each end of the, each side of the building, actually.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Well, not.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: I mean, maybe.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: I mean, because the dock doors are in egress, so.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: And then, and then what else do you need, Jay?  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah, that's about it.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: I think.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: I think we got everything else.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: And what time are you meeting with our Amazon friends tomorrow?  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: What time do you have to present?  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: Presentation is on Monday.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: Tomorrow is just a mission.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: So you have to submit it by the end of the day.  
[00:02] **AJ Taylor**: And Jay, so then you're no longer needing like an order of magnitude budget, right?  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: No, no, we need.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Nice try, aj.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: We, we absolutely need it.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: We absolutely just.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah, yeah, that's still due for us.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: So if you can get that to us.  
[00:02] **AJ Taylor**: Is that due with your submission tomorrow?  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: No, but it's due tomorrow internally, because I'm, I owe my side of.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: Submissions to the pricing team because we have recurring meetings Monday through a Friday because Friday is when we are due to the next.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: Friday is when we are due to submit and we need to go through internal leadership approvals and operational leadership approvals before it actually goes out to the customer.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: So if we get it end of day tomorrow, it'll be helpful for us to get it out.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: For sure next week.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: So any of these build outs that we're talking about, like any exterior door build outs, any dock level build outs, any of those things that we need to know the cost for all of those things.  
[00:02] **AJ Taylor**: Yep.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Again, I want to be very clear on this, Jay.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: This is going to be a high level budget.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: So you know, we're going to.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, they don't talk.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Be conservative on this.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Like we're going to do it.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: We're going to do square foot numbers, we're going to do takeoffs, but what you typically see from us, right, is it's not going to be the same where you get eight packages, very detailed.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Like we do not have the timer.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: To do that in a day.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Like we're doing this on the fly.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: So we're, we're going to give you a Ballpark number.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: In a kind of a little synopsis.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: But we're going to be conservative.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: We're going to throw a, you know.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: A 10 contingency or something on that.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: To make sure that we got, we got things.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Because there's a lot here.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: That we're doing in a week.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: Right.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: And Brandon, I, you know, can we still assume, Jay, that, you know, it's going to be a condition space.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Yes.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: We need a cost for conditioning as well.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yes.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: So we want to make.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: You mention, Brandon, the doors, you know, even the dock doors that, you know, we're going to have 30 new dock packages, essentially, you know, including doors at this point.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Well, but you're gonna have to replace every door.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Oh, that's right.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Every door.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Sorry, I wasn't thinking of that.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Because that, yeah, so every door has to be replaced with an insulated door.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: We just need dock package, the extra dock packages at 30 of them.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Okay, sorry.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, you're right.  
[00:02] **AJ Taylor**: 30 dock packages.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, yeah, let's go with that for now and then.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Essentially replacing every dock door with an insulated door.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Every dock door and overhead door.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Okay.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: We're, like just short of building the freaking thing.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: I mean, literally, like, there's, I mean, you're not, you're not too far from it.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: I don't think, Honestly, I don't think we need all the 80 doctors to be, to be upfitted.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: I think maybe now we're talking 30J.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: To be 30.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yes, 30 is fine.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: But, Jay, the reason I said every door is because energy code is going to require you to upgrade that entire exterior envelope to meet energy code.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: And right now, all those dock doors that you have, whether you're going to put your dock package on them or not, are uninsulated, and you cannot do that.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: So essentially, you know, we'll have 30 usable doors with the, you know, new insulated doors and dock packages.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: And then the other.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Whatever the remaining dock doors have just have.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: The door itself has to be replaced.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: I, I, we could probably.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: We, we don't have to put, do we have to put a new track or can we just get a new door?  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Get new doors.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: You just get the panels.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, yeah, just get new panels to fit it.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: So we don't need to, you know, necessarily do everything.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: But, I mean, it's still, it's still like your cost because you got a demo.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Like, you're not exactly saving money.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: No, no, I don't say, I'm not saying we're Saving that?  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: No.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: So it's almost like putting in a new door, like, exactly.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: We got to take the old one out.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: We just got to get the, you know, insulation value.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: So that's a good catch.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: All right.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: I think that's it.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: So we got.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: We got to get the order of magnitude to J tomorrow.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Jay's gonna work on updating this a little bit based on our layout, based on our discussion.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Then we got to focus on getting, you know, an egress path because we have, you know, that.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: That presentation due to Amazon on Monday, so obviously, like to get everything wrapped up tomorrow.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Appreciate, you know, all the time considering, you know, the.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: This.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Everything's been compressed with, you know, a new building and everything.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: So I know you guys did a lot of work on the old one.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: So much appreciated on, you know, working with us here.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: So hopefully, you know, we can get this in and we can actually be working on this.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: You know, come 2026.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: So.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: Cool.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: All right, agreed.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: Thank you.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: Thank you.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: I appreciate it.

[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Just shoot me a text or something.  
[00:02] **Brandon Clymer**: Jay, if you need to.  
[00:02] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah, absolutely.  
[00:02] **Kennedy, JP**: All right, everybody, thanks.
