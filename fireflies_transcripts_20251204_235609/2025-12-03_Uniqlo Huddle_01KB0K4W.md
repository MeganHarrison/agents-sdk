## Full Transcript

[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Sorry, Mike, I was stuck on a meeting with Jack.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Oh, okay.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: I use that eraser tool all over this thing here.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Looks a lot more clean.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Nice.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, this is where we're at now, so.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, they definitely slowed down a little bit on racking Monday.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: They only got 12 uprights up.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Whoa.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, so I got that documented yesterday.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: They got up to 29.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: So, you know, that meets their 27 target.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: We'll see where.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: We'll see what they do the rest of the week.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: But I don't know what was up with Monday.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: But it's given them some time to focus on these verticals on this side.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: And then I sent that email to Jesse.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Try to get a follow up from.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Let's see if you're back from today.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: I almost forgot to have that meeting today.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, Skipping a week really throws it off.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah, I got, I didn't get to start the agenda yesterday, so I gotta jump in the.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: I think.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Didn't we start the agenda for last week before we canceled it?  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yes, actually we.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: We actually did create it already.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: We should be able to really like copy and paste everything.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: I was saying, I'm not sure about all the billing details and everything.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah, yeah, I think that would be some.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Just a few updates here and there, but.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: You know, we can.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: It'll be the same thing with racking and sprinkler.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: I'll mention the verticals.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: We haven't mentioned anything about the electrical inspection getting approval, so we'll talk that in.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah, yeah.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So some of these.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Some of the information I'll just pull from the.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: The weekly report from last week because that, that has the inspection and.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Android attachment.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So it should be able to.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So will they be starting the verticals on the west side of B today or are they starting a different time?  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: I mean, they've started it yesterday.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: They looks like.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Looks like they have one more.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: So they.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: So what they do first is they put in the fabricated pieces all attached to the brackets and everything first.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Connections.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Then they make the connections and then they start to move, you know, shift the main over and then get in the slick 3 inch piece that we got delivered yesterday.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: So.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: So it looks.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: And so they have one more fabricated piece to put in and then.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: And then they're moving on to the, to that part.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Gotcha.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: And then like I said, I sent that email to Jesse.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: I would like to get.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: I would like to, you know, start testing as soon as possible.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: And really that just means we just need, just need to plan to have a couple extra guys here for at least.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: At least two to three days.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Gotcha.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Cool.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Cool.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: And so I. I did send an invite to Joe to go over the schedule and make some.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Oh, yeah, 2:30.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: To call Chris, ask about the shipping of the compressors.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: And.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: I think that's.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: That's about it.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So yesterday when I had the meeting with the job planner, I showed them Jesse's contact information with the.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: The line blown through it.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: They said that's, that's because account was deactivated.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: It was marked as inactive.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: And.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: I must have done that by accident or something.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: But there is a.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: There's a.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Like a button when you click, it just turns it, you know, inactive.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So it went back.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So I just clicked it and came back to life.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Gotcha.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah, I don't know.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: So.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: You said usually it works with.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: With his.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: His name.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Right.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: And when was the last time you did it and it worked?  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Do you remember the last day?  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Tuesday of last week?  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: It's weird because on Job Planner you can take a look at the history, and according to Job Planner, it was done on.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: On the 5th of August.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So that makes no sense.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Huh?  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Sorry.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: On August 25th.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: That don't make sense.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: It does not.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: But anyway, so I guess now we know that's how it's done.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Gotcha.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Okay, I'm gonna jump onto the.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: The.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: I'm gonna look at the report and see if I can transfer some information to the agenda.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: And once I finish it, I'll let you know so we can.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: We can go over it.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: All right, sounds good.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: If not before 2:30.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: See?  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: At 2:30.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Okay, sounds good.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: All right, Kevin.
