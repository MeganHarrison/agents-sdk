## Full Transcript

[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I didn't realize this was sent from my email.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And I was the one that had to let everybody in the lobby.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: My bad.  
[00:00] **Riley McCarthy**: No problem.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Oh, sorry, I'm driving right now.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: It's been a busy day.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Gotta get to the airport here soon.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: How are you?  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Good to see you, Nick.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Good to see you, Brandon.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: All, all good.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: And if this isn't a good time, we can always, we can punt, but.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: No, it's fine.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I, I again, it's, you know, in our hectic, you know, end of the year schedules, I have to do what it is.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Unless, unless I need to be in front of a computer for something, I'm happy to take it on the phone.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: No, you're good.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Tis the season and our hope actually today is to touch base on a few things so that our, the rest of our year is a little smoother and easier.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: So hopefully a little, a little pain now is a little pain relief later.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Well, hey, I'm just going to kind of jump right in and Riley will kind of supplement if I'm missing something here.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: But we really wanted to touch base quickly at a broad level just on kind of some of your goals for the sponsorship.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: So, you know, for example, we have some sponsors that are really keenly interested in connecting with other goodwill organizations.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Some are really interested in connecting with like, local business leaders.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Some are just not interested at all in the recognition piece.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: So just kind of giving us a baseline.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: There's, and then we've got a few more detailed questions on some things kind of coming up the rest of the year, but I just was hoping to start there and.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Are you talking about unboxing or.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: So as part of your sponsorship for unboxed, we could do, there's all kinds of different ways that we could recognize that support.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: And so just kind of starting at the, at the base level of, you know, what are your priorities?  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: What's important to you with the sponsorship?  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, I mean, you know, really, the.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: We value you guys as a partner.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: We enjoy working with your team.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And what you guys do is, is obviously beneficial to the community.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So, you know, that's the, the main reason.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I mean, all, all other things aside, that's the, you know, one of the main reasons to be one thing, if you were a pharmaceutical company and we were giving you money, then that'd be odd.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: But you guys help the community.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So, yeah, that's the, that's the biggest thing.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And then as far as, you know, recognition, things like that, you know, I, I think I talked about like, you Know, I wanted to take that, you know, for, for next year, take that, that spot from Sullivan and you know, have a nice, you know, video and be a, you know, principal sponsor or whatever, title sponsor, I guess what you call it, that would be great.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And then the other thing as far as business wise is, you know, we're really obviously trying to grow and get into other networks, Goodwill networks across the country.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So that, that's the, that's the main goal, especially with, for instance, like the Excel center, you guys being the, the ones that started it.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: You know, kind of, we do pretty much all those for you guys at this point.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And so being able to take that and.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Take your guys's programming, your standards and make sure they're met around the country is one of the things I talked to Ken about.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: But yeah, that's, those are, those are really the main drivers.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Awesome.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Okay, well, thank you.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: That, that makes a lot of good sense.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: So I think in terms of the partnership with, with our goodwill, there's a few things that we can do with that.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: One of them is called the partner event.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: I'll talk about that in a little bit.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: There's an opportunity there in terms of connecting with other Goodwill markets.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: That's something that Riley and I worked on a little bit last year where we tried to get other Goodwill CEOs to come and attend unboxed.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: That went okay.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: I think this year we have a lot more tools in the tool belt in terms of kind of encouraging folks to come.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: So I know Kent will be inviting his, you know, CEO colleagues from other Goodwills.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Riley and I have some personal connections.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: So I think this will be a really good year to help grow some of that too.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: And then, Brandon, if there are specific goodwill markets that you're interested in, that's helpful for us to understand.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: That might be a formal introduction over email or whatever.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Or it could just be as simple as, hey, we're in the big room together.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Let me make sure that, that we connect you with who you want to talk to and facilitate those introductions.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, I mean, the, the main market, I would say like the, you know, the low hanging fruit is we have a Tampa office.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So the greater Tampa area.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So that would be, you know, St. Pete, Tampa.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: You know, Brandon, you know, you know, all the, I'm not sure what the markets are broken up into down there, but that would be an easy low hanging fruit one.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Then obviously other markets around here.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So the, yeah, I'm not sure what Southern Illinois or it was in Northern Kentucky and things like that.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Where Those are, those are easy ones.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And then as far as the Excel centers, I mean that again, that's, I feel like, because you guys, everybody comes to you, that is an easy entryway to be like, hey, these guys do the design and the build across the country.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: They know the programming, you know, to make sure that they're adhering to your guys standards.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Okay, well, I'm already thinking through.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Sarah Thomas is actually also connected to the Goodwill Foundation.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: She's responsible for the Excel national office and the expansion there.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: So if you haven't met her, had a conversation, that's probably something we can help with.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, yeah, I have.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I know her and I can't remember the other person that works with her in that, but yeah, I've spoken to him and you know, they said they'll, they'll let me know if, you know, if there's an opportunity or something.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So I, you know.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: That'S, I guess the gist of where that's at.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Well, we can always help, help, you know, poke and nudge and all that too, if that's helpful.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, I mean, I mean, again, I.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: The biggest thing is, you know, what's, everybody's like, you know, what's in it for me?  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: It's one thing to come and say, hey, like, you know, help me grow my business.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: But at the end of the day, like, it all comes around, right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: We obviously, we grow then, you know, we want to turn around and give back even more.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Because we have more to give back with.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: And that's, you know, I'm gonna, I'm gonna transition to that partner event, but because I think that's a really important concept for this, for this piece.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: So, you know, for us and Sullivan is a great example.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: We don't, we would prefer, you know, we'll take a check from anybody, whatever, but we'd prefer not to have a transactional relationship in the foundation.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: We really want, like true partners.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: To your point.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Exactly.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: We're working together, we have shared goals.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: We're looking at the bigger picture together.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Right.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: It's not just a, you know, once a year I'm coming out with my hands out saying, hey, can you write us a check?  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Right.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: That's right.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Exactly.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: That's not what we're trying to do here.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So Brandon and I, and I know you're, I know you're not Nick, I don't want you to think that I feel that way by any means.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I, I don't think, you know, you guys ever hit us up or asked Me to sponsor.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I think it was one of those things where, you know, we.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: We said, hey, we want to, you know, support you in ways more than just, you know, what we do for you and the service side.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: And we try to ask, you know, anybody that we do business with, we certainly say, hey, we have this event, and if you want to support the mission, here's, you know, here's a way you can do that.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: But especially for that title spot, we're.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: We're thrilled that, you know, that you share that perspective, and then we can go a little deeper, so.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Well, hey, real quick, Brandon and I apologize.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Remind me, I think you might have attended, but I cannot be sure.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Have you been to a partner event before with Goodwill?  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Does that ring a bell at all?  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: If I had.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I mean, I don't know.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I've been.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: It's been.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I've been working with Goodwill for seven years now, so I'm sure maybe I have.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Like, I don't.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I didn't go to the last one.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I know that.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: I.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: For some reason, my memory.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: I think you have.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: But I also have learned not to trust my memory these days.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I thought you had one at Sullivan Hardware once.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Yes, sir.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: That was the first one.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I was at that one.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Because I think that was the one where, like, I like that.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I was like, I can't remember what it was, but I think I gave like, 30 grand or something like that.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I was like, yeah, we're good for.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: You know, whatever you were at.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Was it GDI?  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: No, Peterson @ the.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Time.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Peterson, that's right.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Man, that feels like a long time ago.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: I.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Know.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: It was four and a half years, five years ago now, I think.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Anything before COVID is just sort of a.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Or maybe that was during.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: I don't know, Whatever.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: So that event is live, and, well, we have some flexibility in terms of the timing of it.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: But we wanted to talk to you because that can be a particularly good opportunity to get in front of local businesses and especially other business partners that are involved with Unboxed.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: So especially last year, we tried to transition a little more to a, you know, recognition event where it's like, hey, thank you to all of our sponsors for last year.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Here's a little heads up about what Unbox is going to be like this coming year, this year.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: And then we usually have it hosted at different organizations.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Like last year, Old national bank, they're a sponsor.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: They do a grant.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: They've got someone on a young professionals board.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: They do volunteer Projects they wanted to host.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: It said, oh, that's great.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: So this year with Alito, we wanted to kind of hold and give you first rider refusal, so to speak.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: With our new foundation office up and running, which obviously, you know, your team delivered on to get it here, we wanted to know what you thought about us hosting the partner event at the foundation office, and then Alito is kind of the.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: The.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: The sponsor, the host of that event as.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Well.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, certainly happy.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Happy to.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Hopefully you guys like it, and if there's any issues, obviously, please, please let us know so we can take care of.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: It.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Okay, well, if you like that idea, I'm gonna let Riley and I kind of put our heads together and get a little more detail in terms of the.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: The date and what it would.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: The gist would be, hey, thanks to all our sponsors last year.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: I think this would be a great opportunity to kind of announce, hey, Alito is our title sponsor for this year.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: You know, here's Brandon to share a little bit about the business and what they do.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: You know, they.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: They worked on this building, so walk around, check it out, you know, that kind of stuff, and we can give you a little more detail about that.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: We were thinking kind of sometime around May or June, and if you or your team have.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Is there a particularly good date or time frame for you, we can schedule it that.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Way.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, I. I don't know off top of my head, but I'll get with Maria, especially as we plan out the year here.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I'll know more in the next two weeks of what, you know, my next year looks like.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And, yeah, she'll.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: She's the best one.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: You know, she can line up those dates and, you know, block out my.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Calendar.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Yep, absolutely.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: And we'll follow up with all those details too, for her and include her as well.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: And then a couple.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: More.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Are.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: You.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: You okay on time to.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: 12:30?  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, yeah, I'm good.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Yep.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: So then shifting gears a little bit, the.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: The unboxed event specifically.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: So you had mentioned the video piece.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: That's definitely on our mind as well.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: One of the.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: The benefits that Sullivan had with the video was that we already had a lot of content about them because they were also the winner of what we call the partner connections of the year award process.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: This year.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: We're going to need to generate more content about Alito from Alito, with Alito to kind of get the pieces we need for that video to come together.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: So I'm just kind of raising that up now, you know, and in the coming days, we can figure out, oh, here's kind of the, the story we want to tell with this video and, you know, understanding what's important to you guys in terms of what gets represented there.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: But in the meantime, we really just wanted to lift up, you know, if you have content from, you know, the foundation office, if you guys are out working in Illinois or wherever else and you're working on Goodwill projects, you can't take too many photos, you can't get too many video clips, because all of that could be really good raw material for that.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Video.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: And.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Yeah, yeah.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: And I would add, it's also a great, you know, now between the next, I don't know, three or four months, if Alito has any interest in a group volunteer project, a donation drive, some of those kind of employee engagement kind of things, it's also a good time to do that just because then we can also capture that content and include in that video as kind of the partnership story.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: So, you know, some organizations, they do a lot of that stuff, and they love it.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: For some, it's just not a fit.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: So we'll follow your lead in terms of fit.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: But we just wanted to kind of raise up the timing element of.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: That.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I, I mean, I, you know, it's like, oh, yeah.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I mean, we should be doing a volunteering event that.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I'd say that the issue or the, the struggle with us is that multiple, obviously multiple offices, and even then, like, across the country, like, a lot of our people are field staff, and so they're, you know, to fly everybody in is a challenge.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: For a.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Day.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Sure.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: And again, it may, it may just be, hey, it's just not a good fit.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Or it could be.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: I mean, again, we've got some companies that will, oh, we have three or four people, and they're volunteering at the Carmel store this afternoon.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: You know, whatever.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Again, talk to Maria, talk to your team, if that's, if there's any part of that that's interesting.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Go ahead.  
[00:00] **Riley McCarthy**: Riley.  
[00:00] **Riley McCarthy**: I'm sorry, I was gonna say we're also able to do like a virtual, like, lunch and learn, if that's of interest, of sharing your support of Goodwill throughout your organization.  
[00:00] **Riley McCarthy**: And, and you'd like to take the opportunity to gather your employees and associates and would like them to know about the partnership.  
[00:00] **Riley McCarthy**: We're happy to, you know, to do, like, a virtual learning session.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Too.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, I, I, I, I'll, I'm trying to think here, like, what the best, you know, what the thing is to communicate and how the Best way to do it.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Because one thing is too, right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Like, is.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: It's like, all right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Well, I like to say, like, we're big on, like, stay in your zone of genius, right?  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Like, what are you good at?  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: What are you.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Can you get the highest roi?  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And so time is obviously a resource.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And so what can we get the highest?  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Like, yes.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I mean, going in and sorting goods at a Goodwill in the back of house or something like that is one thing, but it's like, what can we actually donate that we're really good at that could provide a lot of value that other people couldn't do?  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Which obviously is going to lead me more to the building side of things.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So I may ask Jared kind of what his thoughts are on that.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I'm sure he's got a wish list of stuff that Kent won't pay for.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: But, yeah, that's.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I mean, that's kind of what I'm thinking.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: It would be probably something cool.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And especially because again, we're, you know, we're construction guys, right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: We're builders.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Right.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: So for us, you know, actually doing the stuff, hanging the, you know, that.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: That would be, I think, a cool, cool thing possibly.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: But, yeah, I mean, I, you know, I probably need to talk with our marketing team and ask them their thoughts and.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: And see what everybody thinks, because obviously I'm just one person and everybody else may be like, no, dude, I don't want to go hang drywall.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Like, let's go sort clothes.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: And you know, Brendan, one thing I'll add to that, too, is you and your team kind of start having those discussions.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: So we recently merged with an organization called Horizon House.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: They're a nonprofit in Indianapolis that primarily serves people experiencing homelessness with like a day center, although they do have some long term supportive housing as well.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: So for a couple of different reasons.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: One, because this is kind of the concept of housing and supporting unhoused people has become a bigger priority in Goodwill's kind of core mission.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Right.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: It's now become one of our pillars, along with employment, education and health.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: And because we're hoping to integrate supporters of Horizon House into the kind of Goodwill family, so to speak, we want.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: We're really considering and I think are moving forward to some degree with having housing be a thematic focus at UNBOX this year.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: So maybe even something like that, Right.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: If you and your team are like, oh, it'd be kind of fun, we could help build some installations with the event or something, you know.  
[00:00] **Nick Ison**: Yeah, Wishlist is probably the priority, but I'll throw it out there to say, you know, we've probably got other opportunities to be.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Creative.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, no, I think that's cool.  
[00:00] **Brandon Clymer**: I think I remember hearing something about that with a Horizon house.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: So, yeah, I think there's definitely some opportunities.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Again, I'll get with the.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Our marketing team and see what they.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: They say and stuff.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: And then definitely, you know, we've got, you know, videos for.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I mean, we're.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I think we're about ready.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: We're doing one up in a store in Kokomo or something in Allisonville.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: And then we're about ready to do the Noblesville Cell Center.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I think that one starts in like two weeks or three weeks maybe.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: So then, yeah, we'll.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: We'll be able to.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I'll make sure that we.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: We get extra.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Plenty of video and stuff like.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: That.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: That'd be.  
[00:01] **Riley McCarthy**: Great.  
[00:01] **Riley McCarthy**: Great to know some of those dates too, Brandon.  
[00:01] **Riley McCarthy**: And we also work.  
[00:01] **Riley McCarthy**: One of our other sponsors is a video production team, so it could be that we are coming to one of the facilities if, you know, we wanted to arrange for.  
[00:01] **Riley McCarthy**: I don't know if you have branded trucks or signage that we want to, you know, be showing in the footage.  
[00:01] **Riley McCarthy**: And we'll also want to make sure that we have, you know, testimonials from you and your executive team, whoever.  
[00:01] **Riley McCarthy**: Whoever you'd like to see in the video.  
[00:01] **Riley McCarthy**: We'll probably set up some time to.  
[00:01] **Riley McCarthy**: To grab that footage with our own crew as.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Well.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, that'd be.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: That's a great idea because I, I know like, for instance, these.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: A lot of the grand openings and stuff that we attend, it's usually just, you know, us kind of recording video and stuff and, you know, they'll, you know, whoever.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I cuts it up and does stuff on our end.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: But yeah, I think that's great because we, yeah, we are not, you know, we're.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: We're builders, not marketers.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: That's.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: That's very well.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: Seen.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: Yeah, that's a good.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: That's a good call out there.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: And then I, I'll.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: I'll.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: I'll wrap us up on a similar topic, the.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: The press piece.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: So we, you know, unbox kind of has a cycle in terms of public media and social media and all that kind of stuff.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: We're sort of wrapping up the, like, hey, thanks for last year.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: It was awesome.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: Blah, blah, blah, blah.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: We're getting ready to kind of kick off the next cycle of communication, I guess, and we'd like to start it with a.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: Hey, we're announcing our title sponsor, Lido.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: You Know, super exciting, yada, yada.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: So just wanted to check.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: Brandon, your.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: Your.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: Your team, and obviously there's no great rush.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: You can talk to your.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: To your marketing folks, but the idea of doing a press release, you know, sometime in the next couple weeks maybe, and.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: Or a big social media, you know, at least on our channels, you know, your channels too, if that's something you're interested.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: In.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Oh, yeah, definitely.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Just, you know.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, I mean, I guess.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Let me know.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Again, you guys are better at this than we are, so let me know.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Hey, here's what we typically see.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Here's what we're thinking.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: But that's definitely something that I would really like to.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: Do.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: Great.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: Well, we can.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: Yeah, like I said, we can follow up with the details there, so.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: Well, Brandon, thank you.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: That was my list.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: Riley, is there anything that we haven't covered that you think would be.  
[00:01] **Riley McCarthy**: Helpful?  
[00:01] **Riley McCarthy**: I'm trying to think.  
[00:01] **Riley McCarthy**: We really appreciate you attending unbox the past couple years.  
[00:01] **Riley McCarthy**: So in addition to the video, were there any areas of the event that you would like to see sort of activated and branded for.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Alito?  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I mean, you know, the events, you know, you guys do a great job and everything.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: You know, you talking about, like, as far as signage and stuff.  
[00:01] **Riley McCarthy**: Or.  
[00:01] **Riley McCarthy**: Yes, signage.  
[00:01] **Riley McCarthy**: Or is there any type of displays that you want to have that showcases your.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Business?  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, I mean, I, you know, I think.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: You know, like, one thing, like, it'd be cool if we did a display, you know, with.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: With us and like, maybe we create some sort of, like, video about Oedo and what we do with testimonials that could throw on a loop that, like, people could go by and like, here's our title sponsor, right?  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: And they could.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: They could watch it if they wanted to.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: That I think that might be cool.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I mean, again, this is.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: You're asking a guy who, you know, throws concrete on the ground to what's a good marketing.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: So I think that's cool.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: But.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, and that's just the first thought.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: But I mean, maybe the.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: The girls and stuff will have other ideas, but is that something kind of what.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: What you're.  
[00:01] **Riley McCarthy**: Thinking?  
[00:01] **Riley McCarthy**: Yeah, that's good.  
[00:01] **Riley McCarthy**: And we can definitely do that.  
[00:01] **Riley McCarthy**: A video on a loop if there's this.  
[00:01] **Riley McCarthy**: The really, we are grateful for your support.  
[00:01] **Riley McCarthy**: And in terms of activation, the world is your oyster.  
[00:01] **Riley McCarthy**: So if you see things at other events that look cool and you want to bring that to unboxed, happy to see if we can work that into with our creative team.  
[00:01] **Riley McCarthy**: If there's, you know, a signature cocktail that we want named after Alito.  
[00:01] **Riley McCarthy**: If there's special signage, anything really that you want to see on site, we'd love to make.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Happen.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Oh, that's cool.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah, I, we, we sponsored a couple events down in Tampa, like real estate stuff, and we did, like, signature cocktails.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: I'll have to ask what we did, but I thought that was thank.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: For.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Sure.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: So cool.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Well, yeah, I like, thanks for reaching out, guys, and we're excited for the partnership and, you know, your guys growth and in our growth as.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: Well.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: Awesome.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: Well, Brandon, thanks for the time and, yeah, thanks for the support.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: We're excited to work.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Together.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Awesome.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Sounds good.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Have a great time.  
[00:01] **Brandon Clymer**: Merry.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: Christmas.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: Merry Christmas.  
[00:01] **Nick Ison**: See ya.
