[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Hello.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Good morning.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Good morning.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: We'll give it a minute.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: We know if.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I guess.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Kevin, do we know if anyone else from your crew is joining us?  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Let me check on aj.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: He might be joining us soon.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Do we have Brandon joining?  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: I'll find out.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay, that's fine.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Hey, jp, Were we able to send them all the information, flyer and everything regarding the new building?  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, I sent that yesterday.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: The pics and the flyer.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay, thank you.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: We still didn't get anything related to a CAD drawing, right?  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: No, no.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: So what I did was I just went ahead and built it based on, You know, what the.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: The length and width and that they had in the.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: In the PDF, the flyer.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So are we.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Is this just.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I mean, I don't know if you're at liberty to say, but it's.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Are we definitely switching buildings or is this just another option?  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: No, we're definitely switching.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: That was a misunderstanding somewhere.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: There was a miscommunication.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: So this is the build.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: This is the building.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: We're going to a building.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Well, the good news, this building has full lighting, so that's good.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yes, I saw that.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Saw the pictures.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yes, that's good.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: It doesn't look like it has any dock door levelers or restraints, but at least it.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: It has lighting.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: A lot to get.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I didn't see anything yet on the, you know, the electrical service or anyone, but.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, but certainly.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, at least it's lit.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: And we can.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: We would just have to relocate lighting based on the racking versus, you know, lighting.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Lighting the whole place up.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Right, right, right, right.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Should we get started or do we have anybody we're waiting on?  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yes, Brandon and AJ are joining.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: They're finishing up a meeting right now.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: They will be joining us.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay, no worries.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, let's.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Let's give it a minute, Jay, and just make sure we have.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yes, I agreed.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Enzo again.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: JP by the way, is Amazon going to provide their own air compressors for this space, or is that already on site?  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Well, I mean that as far as.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: For the mhe.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, that would be part of, you know, our build out.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: We'd have to, you know, include that.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So any power, all that stuff, we'd have to get that.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: We'd have to get that located on the.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: On a plan.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: As far as the whole build out.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: No, we got a box.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: We got to fill it up.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Hey, guys, can you hear me okay?  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yes.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: All right, we got A.J.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Sorry, we.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Me and Brandon are in another meeting.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: That's going probably extra long.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: So you guys get me here for a second.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, because we gotta.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: We have a.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: We have another meeting after this.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yep.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So I may.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I can.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I can move that if necessary.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Or you could.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: That's your meeting actually.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Yeah, and we can push that to a. Yeah, another time.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: So, jp, I saw that you sent an updated site.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Where are you guys at on selection?  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Is this basically figuring out best terms for lease negotiation, etc.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, this is the new site.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Okay, so.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So the other one's out.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Other one's out.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Gotcha.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Okay.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: And I saw the CAD was sitting all that and it's essentially the same size right now.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Well, we didn't send a cad.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: We don't.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Listen, I. I didn't.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Well, we haven't received the cat yet.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: We're still waiting on the cad.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: That was a flyer and.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Okay, I didn't.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: I thought I. I looked at the flyer in the pictures.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: I didn't.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: I thought I saw a cat on there.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: But no, unfortunately not yet.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: If you haven't sent it to me, please.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: So that being said, I know this Friday is the fifth, you guys kind of need an order of magnitude budget.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Is that still the case, even though with the new site.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay, yes.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: So we are working actively now to refine this new layout within this building.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: So we should have a final layout by today, tomorrow, because we are due to.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: We are required to submit a final for this new building.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Apparently there was some miscommunication in the.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: In the location.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: When you type in this new address into Google, it says Miami Gardens, but apparently it's just Miami, Florida.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: So there was some confusion there.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: But apparently this is the building there and we are revising the layout, although we don't have the cad.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: I mean, we know the length and width and the column lengths.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: So we're building out a layout and we are due to submit this on Friday to them.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: I can submit the revised layout to you whenever I have it ready.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: But apparently from a build perspective, and this is something.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: I tried calling Brandon yesterday, couldn't get to his number.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: But I guess we met with Amazon on Monday and there was some feedback based on, you know, they.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: They stress the importance of us using a fire engineer to make sure that we understand what we're doing here from a build perspective because they really wanted to understand and they really wanted to have confidence in us understanding the build requirements.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: And basically what they're stressing on is for us to have the building set up based on a type 1A hazmat building.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: And I think that's, that's the key that they're looking for here.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: When I asked them the question, I said can you tell us how your current hazmat sites are built?  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: And they said type 1A is basically how all of the buildings are constructed.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: And 2B is 50% their buildings are 1A type 1A and 50% of the buildings are type 2B.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: But basically what they're looking for us, even within the plans that we're submitting, even the layout that we're submitting is where exactly the egresses are, what percentages of the storage needs to be against the actual brick wall of the actual facility.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Critical things like that.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: What's the nearest egress point from where this associate would be?  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Let's say, for example, if we have a two level mezzanine within that mezzanine area, what's the closest?  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Maybe it's 100 or 150ft, whatever that is, that the fire engineer will tell us.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: That's what we need to understand.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Like we need to build the storage, we need to build the building based on this type 1A that they were looking for us to build.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Because their fear, their fear is that they'll go ahead and award this to someone and they've been burned before that, you know, like their fear is all of the cost to build out all.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: And consider all of these things were not built in into the plan.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: And then the county or the, you know, the permits, we would have issues from fire departments and other places when we actually go and build it out.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: So they want us to make sure that we have all of those things in check and in place based on the county regulations, based on the Miami Florida regulations.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: They want us to make sure that we have all of those things in check and in place to make sure everything is.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: All the building codes are adhered to when we're designing this layout.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Does it make sense?  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah, I guess that's what they're looking for us to explain to them.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Is that what all have we considered from a build perspective that actually gives them the confidence that we know what we're doing, Right?  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: And obviously Jay, we can help with all that and start putting all that together.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: So I just want to make sure come and maybe we do another meeting tomorrow Jay, as we start working on it.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: But so I do know this much and like I said, Brandon is a lot more knowledgeable when it comes to this code than I am.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: I know enough to be dangerous.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: So I know that type 1A.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: That's the type of building it is.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: But it kind of goes hand in hand with that H3 occupancy.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: So type 1A, it's, I think it's like IBC chapter 6 I want to say it's essentially how the building's built.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: So that's the actual shell building.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: So we will need to confirm that that's what that building is classified as that you guys are looking at.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: And then occupancy then goes with the H3, the, the combustible or semi combustible material.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: So.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: A typical warehouse is usually type 2 I'm pretty sure.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: And so what, what type A will consist of is it'll be like your structural frame is three hours bearing walls, exterior, interior.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Those are three hour rated floor construction, roof construction, etc and, and which a precast building I think is already three hours.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: So I need to look at the flyer you guys have to confirm and then that will coincide with the occupancy which it will have to be an H3 occupancy.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: We already know that especially in the storage areas.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: So.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: I want to get back to kind of the construction like portion of it when it comes to a budget.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Are you then looking for this, this, this Friday you're still looking for kind of an order of magnitude, you know what the cost is going to be to build all this?  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Correct?  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Correct, yes.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Like all of the like automatic sprinkler systems.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: All of.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: And they also said something about which, you know, which, which we actually remember seeing is that there was a certain limit to the height from where the product product is stored to the, where the, the nearest ceiling needs to be.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: So if we need to drop the ceiling, we need to think about those things as well.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: So if it is for example, if it is a, I think Brandon mentioned earlier, if it is a two level mezzanine, we need to make sure that's a horizontal barrier.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: We need to make sure that we have the fire separation or you know between the.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: We need to make sure we have the correct height and the space from the shelf rack to the ceiling and then the correct fire suppression systems and things like that.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Also need to like when we send you the layout, you know we, we would, we would, we would expect you all to mark where the exit entry points should be and like all the where exactly the builds need to be.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Any guidance as far as how we should be building this based on the H3 type 1A construction?  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: They, they agree, they agreed that the type 1A construction is the gold standard.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: But they want us to go ahead and, and design it for type 1A.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Although technically they may not need it for type 1A.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Yep.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: But for the bid they're requesting us to.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Because their fear is, you know, if, if we go ahead, if their, their plan is if we go ahead and design and build for type 1A that like, you know, that we would have covered for everything that's included in type 2B or type 2A and also, you know, in type 1A.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: So we'll go above and beyond what's required.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: I think that's what that.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Right.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: They're trying to make sure that we don' any impedance in the Go Live timeline by making sure we have all of the things in place for a type 1A building.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Although it technically may not.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Like you said, it may not need it.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Right.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: So for example, like structural frame three hours bearing wall three hours flooring construction two hours, roof construction one and a half hours.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: All those things that we think we're talking about like fire resistance ratings.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: All those things that we're talking about, we need to make sure that we were showing them in like a PowerPoint.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: We show them that we're, we've thought about all these things and if we need a working session, like once we have the layout ready maybe today, tomorrow I can sit with you because I have a meeting with them on Monday where I need to give them a brief presentation on the revised solution and the layout, but also talk about what we thought about through.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: For the fire from a fire construction perspective.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: What all have we thought about from the building construction perspective?  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Right.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: So A.J.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: i think, I think whenever you guys have time, I think maybe, maybe tomorrow or day after.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: I think I want to make sure that, you know, I have all the PDF, I have all the like if you guys can put up a few slides or a couple of, just a couple of slides, not too much and you know, based on what all we think we should.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: We will, we will be including in this, in this proposal from a build standpoint.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: I think that's all we need to include.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Yeah, yeah, no, that, that's very helpful I think.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: I mean we really need that layout.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: I, I've started to build order of magnitude budget Jay, based off the old one.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: And so that's, it won't affect too much.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: You know, that's more plug and chug as far as my, my, my numbers go.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: But if you can get me that new layout, I would say if you can by end of the day today, that way me and Brandon can work.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: On it tonight, get you something by end of the day for sure.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: So at least you should have something.  
[00:00] **Hanjra, Jai**: I'll give you a PDF and a cad.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: I'll drop it.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: So what I've been doing is.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: I also highly recommend.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: I've dropped a couple of files within the folder that I've shared with you that has pictures from, like, pictures from their existing building that we toured.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: It has.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: It's a document and the document has pictures and the document starts with na.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: So it's a tenant document that starts with na, underscore ef.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: And that document has all of the things that you need to understand from a flow perspective, from a building layout, like a pictures perspective, like all the shelves are, how the racking is and all that stuff.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: So, yeah, okay.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: I'm looking at our calendars right now.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: I can see Brandon's.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: So.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: By the way, I have to drop.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Sorry, I'm getting a call.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: I'll have to connect with you later, aj.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: Okay, let's just.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: Let's plan on meeting tomorrow, Jay.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay, that's fine.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Yeah, that's fine.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: I'm ready.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: All right.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay, thank you.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Hey.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, aj, just hang on a second.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: So, yeah, tomorrow, I'm just gonna see here what.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: What Jay has open since he had a drop.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: Yeah, I just.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: I think obviously morning is probably best because that gives us the day to think about.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: My day's fairly open all day.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: Brandon's.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: It looks like his morning is probably best.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, we have time between 10:00am and 11:30.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Days busy.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Nine to 10.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: And I'm booked 9:30 to 10.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: So, yeah, the earliest we can meet is 10.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: So you want to just plan on 10?  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, I'll.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: I'll send out.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: So basically, we need to re.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Review the new layout that Jay's working on, right?  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: So that you can.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: You guys then can have half a day to go close to them.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: You never make it easy on us, do you?  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Well, I, you know.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: No.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: And I know it wasn't Jay's fault, so I'm not.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: But when they told me they had the wrong building, I'm like, you've got to be shitting me.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Are you crazy?  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: How do we get the wrong building?  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: We did all that work and, you know, you went down to, you know, obviously you were going down anyway, but you took time out of your trip to do that.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: And then they were asking, oh, can they get down there?  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: And I said, well, guys, they're not.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: They don't have daily trips to Miami.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: So, I mean.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: We want to win.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: This so we do have daily trips to Miami.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Right.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: So.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: And I talked to Brandon about.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: And I, you know, I wasn't.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: You know, we're just trying.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: I think we can do most of what we need to do.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: I mean, you know, some of the work we're basically going to have to port.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yep.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: From the other.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: I mean, this is a little built, you know, we have a little more space, I guess, you know, another 50,000 square feet of space overall.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: So, you know, hopefully Bill will, you know, give us a little more room to breathe.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: But.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, let's.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: I'll set up the meeting with the same folks between 10 and for 10, 10 to 11.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Hopefully Jay has an updated layout that we can review.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: And then, you know, we'll try and adjust the numbers, you know, some of the numbers you already have.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Right, so.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Because you have some of the numbers already based on the last building.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: Yeah, yeah.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: I mean, I, I have enough to be dangerous, but I, I haven't.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: I was hoping to maybe be able to finish it tonight, tomorrow morning, but after this meeting, you know, just.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: I just need that new layout and.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: And then.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: Okay.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: Obviously, we're here as a tool for you guys, J.P. so we want to give you everything you need for this meeting.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: You just get with Jay, make sure you guys are very specific on what you expect from us in those slides.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: And as far as the code review goes and all that, we're plenty capable of getting all that in like a.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Mentioning the fire engineer.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: No, I mean, I said that's not an issue.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: I mean, we're going to.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, yeah, we're going to do all that.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: That's not, you know, anything special.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: I mean.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, the most important thing in this building is fire, you know, is the storage and fire protection.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: So.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: And to make sure that the life safety stuff is taken care of.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: So, um, yeah, I said that's.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: That'll all be taken care of.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: And I, you know, I know they want.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: I know they want, like, to be 100% sure, but I feel like saying, like, we'll get as sure as you can without actually submitting plans to the city.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: You know, there's only so much, you know, any, you know, as well as any, Any inspector can decide, for whatever reason, they want something different.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: So, yeah, I like to venture to think.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: And Miami is a totally different ball game when it comes to building in Dade County.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: Yeah, yeah, I do know that much.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: All we can do is go by what's published and available, but, you know, I keep.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: I kind of laugh Because I'm like, guys, this really doesn't hit the road until you submit plans.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: And, you know, we can tell Amazon.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: We got to cover it as much as we can cover it without actually getting the job, submitting the plans and waiting for the comments.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: So, anyway, all right, I'll set up the meeting.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: We'll talk in a few.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: About Martinsville.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, Martinsville.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Hopefully that won't take too long.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: I did see you sent out the.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: The breakdown, so I just had a couple of questions on that, and then I think we can shorten that meeting up a little bit, hopefully.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: So I'll talk.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: I got it.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: Yeah, I got to hop in to this other meeting, JP that I was.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: This guy was on central time, and so I, like, triple booked myself today.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Very nice.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: So I. I. Yeah.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: So that being said, I didn't factor in the central time, so.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: Kevin, make sure you give JP his updates.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: Jp, I will be there on Monday, so I'll see you Monday as well.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: And then.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: If you're not.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: If you're not able.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Just the one question I had while you're here real quick.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: So I saw that you had the demo of the sprinkler.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: You know, the main sprinkler line, you know, cap demo and cap it.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Did you have it, like, just back to the riser, or did you have it just back inside, you know, the shell of the building somewhere?  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: You know that.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: Back inside the shell of the building.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: If I.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: If I remember correctly, that riser, we can tap it there at the top because it's kind of a man that's going.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: That's serving that whole thing.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: Because I think we only got.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: I only got a price for 2,500 bucks for that, so it wasn't like.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: It's not a ton of work.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, yeah.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Because the.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: I just learned the landlord wants it back to the riser, which I think isn't that much more work.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: So, yeah, okay, fine.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: I'm gonna submit what we got then.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: I'm still working out the racking and the timing on that, but.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Because I want to get you guys released because we're running out of time, so.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: All right.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: And I did get a price on the racking, by the way.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: I think I was at, like, 18 grand or 19 grand, just in case.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: I know that this guy's going to do it for free, but I know.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, yeah.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: He's not doing it for free anymore because he wants this once that.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: And we're not giving it to him, so he's going to get me a price by Friday.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: I'm meeting another guy that we've used on other projects.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: I forget their.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: Grand for my same demo guy.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: So if it makes sense for him to do it, you know, just grand.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Okay, yeah, that's good to know.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: I'll see what this guy can do.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: The.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: The other.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: The other big thing is that my.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: The guy was doing for nothing, said he needed six weeks.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: And I said, you don't have six weeks.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: You got two max.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: He's like, oh.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: I said six weeks.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: What do you got?  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: You know, two guys tearing a shit.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: I mean, anyway, all right, so 19 grand, you can get it out of there, coordinate it with the other building.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: I mean, to me, at last, I would just, you know, if we couldn't get somebody, I would just freaking tear it down with the building, you know?  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: I mean, you got it.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: You can't.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: That's some pretty.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: I know.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: Tear it down with the building.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: But we would like to tear it down before the whole.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: I know, I know, but we're running out of time.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: I'm like, God damn, we gotta get this out.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: One second here.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: I.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: Before we hop off, I. I just want to confirm that that is the proper pricing I got.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: I scared myself there for a second.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: I heard 19 grand.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: That's what I heard.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: Which My understanding is.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: Yes, all right.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: I scared myself for a second.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: All right, cool.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: So we got that.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: I'll let you know by.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Hopefully by Monday at the latest.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Because I should have the other pricing by then.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: So we'll have.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: Okay, okay.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Like three.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Three.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: Am I okay to give my.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: No, My demo guy a loi.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: No, do not do it.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Let me get this submitted today.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Wait for, you know, them all to throw a fit before I do, before we do that.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: All right.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: I know, A.J.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: we also need to submit, I think, a change order for the lighting in the cage.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: Yes.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: In the UPS as well.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: So we'll get that to you, jp.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: We have that pricing.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: Um, I was just.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: We have that pricing, right, Kemba?  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Yes, we did.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: From the electrician.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay, we'll.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: We'll send that over to you, jp.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: And I think it's.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: I mean, we should be covered in our contingency.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: So.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, it was the extra lighting along the aisle, Right.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: The drive aisle.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: It was the.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: The ups.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: You know, that what we're going to do with that old ups, or we buy a new ups.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: And then the third one was the putting all the power in the server room on the generator.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Right.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: So there were three different prices that I'm aware of.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Three different changes.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: I'm heading back to the office here shortly, and I will get with Kevin.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: We'll start pulling that together.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: But Kevin, if you guys want to give him an update and everything, I think we're rolling right along, J.P. i mean, we're kind of ahead of schedule.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: A little, so that's good.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, no, I'm I've seen the picks, so I'm not worried about that.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: I just want to get these little.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Little change orders tied up, you know, and get.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: My biggest concern, really, is the demo and having enough time to get this done, so.  
[00:01] **Hanjra, Jai**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: All right, cool.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: I'll.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: I'll talk to you in two minutes, Kevin.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: All right.  
[00:01] **AJ Taylor**: See you guys.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: All right.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: See you.
