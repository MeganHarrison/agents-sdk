[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Well, building the case.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: The only thing that is left is putting up your doors that we have.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: We have started, and we should be done by the end of this week.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: And so it would be that, and the electrician would be back in there to finish up the power drops and all the outlets.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: And for the server room, we have finished the wall construction.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: And correct me if I'm wrong, Jack, is the ceiling up yet?  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Hey.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Will be okay.

[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yes, and they're preparing to.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: To put in the path for the generator.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Do we have any.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: We got installed a generator.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: It's still sitting out there.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: In February.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: We were talking about December.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: We have an update on that.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: On.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Arrival of the generator.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Because didn't we expedite that or get another generator?  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: We did, jp.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: We.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: We did expedite it.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: I don't have a specific date yet for it, but we're getting everything prepared.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: So as soon as it comes in, we'll just be able to set the generator, hook it up and install.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Right now, our goal was to try to have everything done by the new year, so I will confirm a delivery date for you once I have it, and we'll include that on our critical items list on our weekly report.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, let's just update that as you get the information.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, that would be ideal.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Be able to give Brandy and our team, you know, a nice window There to move, you know, to move Amex, you know, over the week, over a weekend.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, because.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, because we still then, right, we need to get them out of building two.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So that we can demo the cage in there.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So not that that's going to take weeks, but, you know, we don't want to leave it till the last minute.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Okay.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Do you know, and this is probably going.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Sorry to hijack it.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Kevin, do you know surely the landlord's gonna give us an extension on that demo.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Right, right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Surely.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I'm going to request it.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I'm working with Paul now to try and lay the groundwork.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Paula, our real estate lady, to try and do that.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: She's not sure that they'll do it, but I think, you know, they've been.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: You know, they're not a run of the, you know, your typical like, corporation, you know.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: You know, landlord.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So corporate landlord.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: They're, you know, they.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I think I could call the guy up.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I just.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: What I want to be able to do is say this is our best case schedule and hey, we may need a couple extra weeks.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: What do you think?  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: You know, can we.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Because we obviously can't pay and are not going to or do not want.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: To pay, I should say at least.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: An extra month's rent just to finish the demo.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: You know what I mean?  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I would like to.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: The two things are, right, obviously we got kind of like an eight week.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Schedule tentatively for the building demo.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: And then I want to firm that up because then I know there obviously is time needed to, you know, repair.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: You know, the exterior of the existing.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Building, you know, and then obviously we talked earlier about the racking in the.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Bill in the freezer.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So I want to be able to talk to the landlord with a realistic.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Timeline and say, look, this is what it's really looking like.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: We got, you know, all the money approved, you know, we got, you know.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Quotes, all that stuff.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: We got, you know.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Yep.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Timelines from you and this is what.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: It really looks like.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: And then see what they'll do and if not, they won't have to figure out something.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Just, just get some dynamite and load up.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Which that's probably the more fun route.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: We're not doing that.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Tell everybody, go home for the day, load up.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Sorry, Brandon.  
[00:00] **Jack Curtin**: Hey, J. I need you to send you.  
[00:00] **Jack Curtin**: I'm going to sign this release form.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Come on.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Can't you just drill a few holes in the side stove, blow it?  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, that's exactly.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, so, yeah, let me, you know, Like I said, let's finish.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I need to get this the finish the Rack quote.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I know you gave me a quote AJ I gotta get its timeline on that.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Does your guy.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Does your guy.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So he would do it as part of the building his over he's.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Because he's doing building demo too.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So like I said that look the local free guy had now says he's not going to be free.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: He's giving me a new new price by Friday.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Which I'm.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: He's not always that punctual.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: And then he said he wanted six weeks like I told you.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So I told him he.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: You don't have six weeks.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I'd like it done in six days.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: You know really.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I mean and I'm meeting another guy.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: There because I could get multiple quotes.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Meeting another guy there.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Will be there Monday.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: There'll be another guy.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: We've used for some.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: They did some of the demo and indie too.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So anyway we'll figure that out Monday.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Fine.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Finalized and then I really need to work on.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I know you need to.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: You want to give a letter of intent to your.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: For the.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: What was it, 500 some odd K for the, the building itself.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: But I, I really want to.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I'm going to submit that today and.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Make sure our leadership is aware of the capex that needs to be spent.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I don't want them coming back and saying whoa.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: And then you've.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: You're on.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: You know, you've released a guy and you're on the hook for anything.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So just wait until I get you know, leadership approval.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Yeah, I understand.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: We just, I mean it shouldn't be.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: A surprise but yeah.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: I think we were only you know, the Amex cage as well and so there's a couple other subs involved.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: But my demo guy would.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: And if you do decide to go with the, with us with the racking, he would.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: It would make the most sense timeline wise.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: So you need to find out how soon they want this done because he could do the racking, the Amex cage and the whole building all in kind of one sweep.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Which would make the most sense.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, yeah.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: No it would.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So but yeah, you know what I'm.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: What I'm in back of my mind afraid of is that you know, we have gone back and forth back and forth about you know, does the doesn't landlord need a demoed blah blah blah.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: And they finally said yeah, just demo it.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Well when I send the half a million dollar bill cost into our leadership I'm afraid they're gonna probably want to try and go back to the landlord again.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: You know, so I don't want you guys committed.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I realize it's a problem from a.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Schedule standpoint, but I'm like, I don't want anybody to get, you know, hooked up here without me getting, you know, having approval on a poc.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Because I got my.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Got my hand slapped on the last one for that.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: We're technically, we're not.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Even though I know you guys will do it.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I'm not supposed to allow work to be done without the po.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So I understand.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yep.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So, yeah, so we got.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: What else is happening with the power.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Over there in the case?  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Because, I mean, the cage is done.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: You're doing.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Except for doors.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: You're doing the doors on that and then you got the power going.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yes.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: The doors are being finished this week.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: By Friday we should have all the doors up and the rest of it would be electrical.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So you have all the layout for that.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So like we mentioned on our last call, it's really just the three minor change requests.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: One was the additional lighting in the, in the, in the drive aisle next to the cage.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I think seven.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Seven lights there.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Adding them in to give a little more light.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Then we had, you know, we discussed last week that old UPS that's sitting in the existing Amex cage doesn't seem.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: To be.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Reusable, I guess.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So we need some sort of solution so we can keep them up and running.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: They want, they want a ups, you know, not just, you know, they don't want it going down between power going out in the transfer switch, kicking the generator on.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So we need, you know, whatever that's going to be.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: And then the third one was adding the existing MDF power onto the generator, which I don't think is a huge deal.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Good.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Still.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So we got those three changes.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, I saw pictures of the mdf.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Do we.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: What's, what's our next step?  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I know you got the walls built, you know, the new section built.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: What's next for that space?  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So right now I'm going to switch my screen so we have all these green area that's all built and the ceiling is being finished today, the new ceiling.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: And then we also have removed part of the existing wall in between.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Now you're removing.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: So and.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Deb, our reasoning for removing the existing wall only to a certain point was so we can keep that existing air conditioner up and running.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: Jp.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Correct here.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: And then how about the Existing ceiling.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: How you're putting in the new ceiling.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: But have you removed the existing ceiling?  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yes, we are removing this and we will be continuing this ceiling all the way.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So it's going to all be Sheetrock.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: And have we, have we covered, right?  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: You know, the, the rack and the.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Gear or protected it in some way?  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yes, we have, we have plastic in there, so everything should be covered from dust and heat.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: And I do have this, this to send your way, JP to pick a color for the flooring.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Pick a color.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I don't give a.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: About the color.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: I, I, I told Kevin you may say something like that.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: I, I do not want to do anything without your blessing, nor does Keva.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: So we'll send you this.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: We'll send you.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: How about this?  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: We'll send you a color we think will look good.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, I mean, so, yeah, it's all the same style.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: It's just, I mean, I don't know.  
[00:00] **AJ Taylor**: It's just color.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: And also, I don't know if there would be someone at the warehouse that would know what color is currently in here to paint the walls.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Do they have an existing or bivy leftover paint that we can try to match?  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Jack, could you, can you get with Charlie?  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, I can get with Charlie.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Charlie would know if we have any.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Paint that we can just do the, you know, match.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, the, you know, the existing walls.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I mean, will match it as close as possible.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I don't think it's, you know, I.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Mean, honestly, if, if it didn't match, then I would just paint the front.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Section, repaint the front section with the door.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Just to the corner.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Right, right.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: And just so that front side looks.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: You know, even, but as long as you get close.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: But Charlie, Charlie probably has some paint that we can use, or at least.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: The color that they, they have on there.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: I think it's a, you know, pretty.  
[00:00] **Kennedy, JP**: General white, you know, I don't think special.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: So.  
[00:01] **Kennedy, JP**: Yeah, Charl will be able to tell you.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: I think that's, that's about it.
