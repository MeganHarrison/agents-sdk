[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Hey, mike.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Hey.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Hey, keba.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: How's it going out there?  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Good.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: So, rex, I got 24 yesterday.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: So we'll keep an eye on that going forward.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: I don't think it's anything we need to address now, but you know.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Okay, they're moving up.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: What's that said?  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Okay, they're moving up a little bit.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, they got the.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: I know in that email they have a target of 27.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Sprinkler guys have an extra guy here.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: They are still working on those verticals.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: We're expecting these verticals to be complete by the end of the day tomorrow.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: And then later today I'm gonna send over some loose material that we need to get ordered from Accufire.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Remember the 2 inch U bolts.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: We're gonna need about 2000.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: We only ordered the 1000.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: But.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yes.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, yeah, we're running.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: We've got a couple boxes left of those.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: So we're going to go ahead and need to get that other thousand.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: We didn't.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: You didn't hear from Jesse about the.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: No, no.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: So I'll give them a call and see around.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: I'm sure what's going on there.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: We're gonna.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: I know we're going to want to order about 104 inch caps.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: That way we can cap off the main.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: So where we can test.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: We can test like.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: We can cut off the testing and you know, test off certain sections.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: So it'll take.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Well, we, you know, we don't want to test the whole thing at once.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Right.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: One because it'll take forever.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: It's going to take a while to get filled up and then, you know, if we have multiple leaks, we want to try to minimize that as much as possible.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Oh, the other thing is the a.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Is the guards.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: I'm going to look into why we are a little short.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Because.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: So it's just going to take some math on my end.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: So we.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: We originally ordered.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: 3360 and.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Then we also ordered 280 for the added lines.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, but that.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: But those were on back order.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: And I'm trying to.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: I should have this information but I don't believe that we've got the 280.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: That was on back orders.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: But I want to confirm that before I.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Say that to accupier.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: We have about 900 left.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: So I just need to do some math and figure out where we're at on those.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: And then.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, obviously we're going to need 2 inch couplings at some point, but we have more Than enough to at least take us into the new year.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: See I saw some pictures.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: They actually don't look bad with the.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, yeah.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Mark saying like he, he, you know, he really doesn't like, you know, using these small pieces and using up these couplings because he said it, it looks bad.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: But I'm like, you know, I think it just looks bad to you because.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: You know, but I don't think anybody.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: It's.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: It's going to look bad to anybody else, you know.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Right, right.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: I think.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Hindsight.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Like going, you know, if you're ever looking at material being ordered for another project to not even order those little pieces like that until either afterwards or just use both pieces.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: And then yeah, they're keeping up on the system a racking.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: I wonder what, what Aaron and John are going to come back with now.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, I don't know.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: I bet, I bet they just say that they're gonna need to check it again when they come back out, which.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Well, yeah, if they do it, I mean we can't do it again.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: The electrician is not there.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So they will just have to take a look at what is there and decide on that.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Do some actual inspecting.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: And if.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: They are not okay with that then, you know.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: It is what it is.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So I am finishing up the PO actually I'm drafting the email to send to Jason.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: I was.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: I was trying to decide if I should put.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: In the scope that one fire stinker.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So they.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: He said he was going to throw in.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: At first.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: I did not.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: But I'm like maybe I should just add it.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So I decided on adding.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Adding furnace and install one fire extinguisher.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: I mean it's probably very cheap for him to say that he's going to throw it in.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So I'm going to send that out and once they sign it we can, we can talk about when they can get on site to do the installation.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: And then I kind of mentioned it to Joe yesterday but you know, Tuesday.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: We can talk with Exotech about the flu space for that.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: That back to back racking where the.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Four levels are going to start.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, I would like to, I would like to get that all installed before they even get there.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: But I mean if we had to because it sounds like they don't even really know this is going to.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: How this is going to go and what it's going to look parts.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: So if we had to wait until they actually start we can.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: That way we can get, you know, make sure everything's at the perfect height.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: But you know, just something we can talk about with them on Tuesday.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah, yeah.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: And then.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: If you have.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: I, you know, I want to be as prepared as possible for the visit on Monday.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: The only thing I'm worried about is.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: One of these rows of lights.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: It's just not centered.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: See what they want to point out or see if.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: See if.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: That.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: I think it's kind of like the, you know.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Where somebody might try to bring.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Show their value and.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, yeah, let's.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: We'll see.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So the first time, who pointed it?  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Was it Yusuke that pointed up?  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Pointed.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: It was on.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: It was Ahmed.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: And they just.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: It wasn't like.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: It just wasn't in a perfect line.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: And now the lights are.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: They're center or they are.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: They're all in a perfect line.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: It looks good.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: It's just one row.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: It's just.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: It's not exactly centered.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: How.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: How much of a difference do you think it is?  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Like an inch, 2 inches?  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: 5 inches?  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: A foot?  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Definitely not a foot, but if I had to guess, I would say a few inches.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: I'll see if I can try to get a picture just to show you.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: But.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah, I know.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: You know, architects, they.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: They like to point stuff like that out.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: I mean, I know functionally it is fine.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: It would be okay.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: This is.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Is this in between.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: The systems or this is.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Wait, it's in the system.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Like, you know how they have the lights centered in the aisles or in the little aisles.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Gotcha.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: I can't think of anything else.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: That.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Or there's nothing else that I'm really worried about.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: So we'll see how it goes on Monday, Sunday.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Mean, I think the point of the visit is just so they can.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: If there.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: If there are any concerns, they can note them, and then I'll note them and then we'll work on addressing it.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: They'll make another visit later on to see if we addressed it.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: And I guess if.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: If they.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: If they are able to see one of those bent guards and they miss.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: They just.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Just say, oh, we.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: We must have missed out something.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: And if.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: I don't know if they keep pushing, I guess when we do the testing and there's some areas that needs to be fixed, maybe we can.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: We can do it around that same time.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Right, right.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: And they didn't mention.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Remember originally we were supposed to get those lifts that go in between the racks from exotic.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Are they supposed to still come?  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Like, from what I.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: From what I know Those.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Those things aren't coming until, like, we're gone.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Oh, all right.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Well.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah, I thought they might be coming in January or something, but.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: And yeah, if you want to.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Want to get together later on, we can get that weekly report ready.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yes.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Were you able to confirm the fire locations, the fire drop locations on the other side, on the outsides.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: If they drop those Ethernet.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: I have a drawing.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: I'm going to see if I can put it up here.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Supposed to be these.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So in between system A and B, these locations.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: And the other two are here.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, those two middle ones are there.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, it looks like these ones are out here.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Pretty confident.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Send the Ethernet cord here.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, they dropped them.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: It's.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: It's right on the.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Out.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: It's right on the outside of the racking, right?  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Like.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah, yep.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, yeah, yep, they're here.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: And.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So right now.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: The racking hasn't come all the way this way.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Right.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Did we stop somewhere here or.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: We did pass where these locations are?  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: I don't know if I'm making sense.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, you are.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: I'm trying to figure out if that is.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: That is system B side you're looking at right now, right?  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: So it looks like.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: I wonder if this is supposed to be the end of racking and it's supposed to be right outside of it.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: I think that is the fence line.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: It's right on.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Right outside of the fence line.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Right now.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: They have it right outside of the fence line.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: So there's two arrows going there.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: So is there two.  
[00:00] **Mike Parsons**: Two fire drops going to each of them?  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: No, there was.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: There was something that happened with this drone.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: I think it shifted for some reason.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: It doubled up.  
[00:00] **Kebba Mass**: But it's just one here, one here, one here.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: So four in total.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: That makes it a little easier on us.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: We don't have to guess where it's going.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: So it does look like it is before the end of the.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: So I wonder if it is past where we stop or is it.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: After or before?  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: You're talking about where we stopped on system B. Yeah.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: I can show you where.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Let me turn my camera on.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: All right, so this is where we're stopped at right now.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: And I'm walking right to that Ethernet drop.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: So we still have this amount of.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: This amount of space between where we stopped and where that Ethernet drop is up.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Right on the outside of the racking.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: So you see, like, this is the last.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: The last row of racking gear.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, it.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: I see.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: All right, so that's.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Try to show you what I was talking about with these lights here.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: This one looks perfectly centered.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: That'S good.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: This one, that is not perfectly centered.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: It's a little to the right.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: I see.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: But this first one, which is the one that Ahmed pointed out when he was here.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: This one is perfectly centered.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Oh, yeah.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: You see it all the way down to system.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Also, they put their tips down.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Their what?  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: The tapes on the floor.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, yeah.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: I. I don't know if man is going to.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: I don't know if he's gonna point.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: It out, but.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: If he does, it's gonna be a punch list item for.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: For dim.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: I mean, I can kind of see why pointed out if it is.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: If it is to light up that.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: That's that aisle for the robots to see.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Huh.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: But.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: But if.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: You know, if he comes and he points out that first one.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Oh, sorry.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: If he looks at that first one that he pointed out before and that's correct, maybe if he sees a nut, checks another one and that's correct too, he might stop looking.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Right.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: But.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah, maybe just.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah, just.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Just keep distracting him.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: That's what I'm thinking.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: There is a.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: There's a lot.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: There's a lot to look at around here.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: I don't know if I should.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Ask.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Jesse if I should come for that thing, for that visit.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: It would be a bad idea, but might be.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Kind of.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Might be a pricey ticket now.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: And they.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: They only go into the site for one day, I. I assume.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Probably like a couple hours, honestly.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: I didn't realize they were flying in from somewhere else.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, I thought.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: I thought they were all coming from New York.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: No, I think Henderson.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Well, Henderson had.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: They have offices.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: A lot of place, but I think they are based in.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Big.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Brian.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: I think Alabama or some.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Some place like that.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Mississippi, Tennessee, one of them.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: And I think Aaron is in New York, but her boss is in Washington.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Seattle.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Gotcha.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Okay, so since.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Those drops are in, I'm gonna.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: I'm gonna call out those locations in the.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: In the weekly report.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: And.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: So maybe if we can get pictures.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Just showing the wire coming down of the four locations.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: And I'll attach that with the drawing and mark it up.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: In.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: And I think we'll probably mark the verticals on B as complete for now for all the locations with three layers, three levels.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Need to ask Suzuki about bringing our fence down.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Maybe I'll do that later.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, I probably wouldn't worry about that for a little while.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Oh, do we still have.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Do we.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Still have a dumpster on site?  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Weird, because I was talking to.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: The dumpster company and.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: They don't seem to think that we have one right now on at the.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: That's on the site.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Really?  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, I called.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: I don't think it was last week, but the week before because you know, I had them emptying this thing out every day for a couple weeks, but now I called or a couple weeks ago I called to confirm that we were back to our three day a week schedule.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah, I don't, I don't know why.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Maybe they still have it on the Camden and they have not connected that it is the same company.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: I need to call them again to clarify that.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: I can call them too, because when I, when I call they already know.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Like I guess they have have my number down so when I call they know exactly.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Where we're at.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Okay.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: I need to ask these guys up here if this thing has even been emptied out this week because I'm not sure.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: It'S full.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Are you, are you following up on or are you tracking what.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Alec is talking about in those emails?  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: A little bit.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna be on the call, just listening.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Yeah, I'll jump on.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: All right, I'm gonna go get some food and I'll try to, try to put this at least at the weekly report and then at some point we can, we can update the schedule.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Sounds good.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Cool.  
[00:01] **Kebba Mass**: All right, we'll talk later.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Thanks.  
[00:01] **Mike Parsons**: Goddam thank you.
